the world to celebrate Christmas, Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, and others have felicitated with as they celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Saraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, also urged Christians to use the festive occasion to pray for unity, peace and prosperity of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">He called on all Nigerians to rededicate themselves to the service of humanity in line with the true teachings of Jesus Christ which emphasise tolerance, patience, brotherly kindness, care for the needy and love for one a</span>nother, among other virtues.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, Dogara challenged Christian faithful to remember to show love to their neighbours and underprivileged as they celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">In a statement to mark the Christmas, Speaker said the Lord Jesus Christ was an embodiment of sacrificial love to the point that He gave His life for the redemption of mankind.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">He said: â€œAs we celebrate the birth of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, let us all remember that it is a time to spread the love of Christ with family, friends, neighbours and the underprivileged in the society.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">On his part, Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, urged Nigerians to emulate the great virtues of humility, love, peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">He said these were the real reasons for the coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">Ekweremadu, who made the call in his Christmas message to Nigerians, said Christmas was an opportunity to reflect on the humility of Christ and limitless love of God<span class="s1">, who gave his only begotten son to be born as man in order to save and reconcile mankind unto Himself.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While wishing Christian faithful and indeed all Nigerians a merry Christmas, Ekweremadu also prayed God to guide the nationâ€™s leaders on the path of Christly virtues of humility, fairness, justice, and kindness for the peace and speedy development of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Also, House Deputy Speaker, Hon. Sulaimon Lasun, also urged Christians to reflect on the birth of Christ and imbibe His preaching on peace and love.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">He said: â€œI rejoice with all Nigerians in general and every Christian family in particular as we celebrate another Christmas in the land of the living, and I pray that the joy associated with the season will be your portion.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">â€œThe belief generally is that the joy of Christmas is not limited to His unprecedented and miraculous birth, but is personality and activities which gave credence to His birth.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Lasun, however, urged Nigerians, irrespective of their religious inclination, to learn how to tolerate each other and live together as one indivisible entity.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"><b>Tinubu Calls for Support for Buhari</b></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, has called for support for President Muhammadu Buhari so that the country can overcome its current challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">He urged Nigerians to learn from the example of Jesus Christ â€œwho faced and overcame the greatest evilâ€ by uniting to overcome our challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Tinubuâ€™s message on the occasion of Christmas was issued yesterday by his Media Office in Lagos.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the message, the APC leader said: â€œToday, Christmas Day, is one of the most precious days of the year for it celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Be you Christian, Muslim or just a human being with a soul that yearns for peace, compassion and hope, Jesus Christ belongs to all of us. His teachings are universal in application and speak of truths eternal.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">â€œThis Christmas, let us acknowledge his birth but let us also give that acknowledgement its fullest meaning</span> by recognising how Jesus lived and what he lived for. He reached out to all. Jesus fed the poor and healed the sick. He spread compassion and charity and preached love and justice. There are no finer aims than these and we can do no better than to do all we can to follow his example.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">â€œLet us all embrace and spread the gospel of love, tolerance and forgiveness this season and into the New Year. We must commit ourselves to peace and unity. Let us eschew all bitterness and bigotry.â€</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">He added that â€œthe challenges that face the country currently are difficult ones. But we keep the hope. We must learn from the example of Jesus who faced and overcame the greatest evil. So let us unite to overcome our challenges.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">â€œWe must support President Buhari and complement his efforts in his resolve to stimulate the economy and reposition the country. The president needs our support, understanding and prayers. We must fully break the terrorism of Boko Haram and completely put down the last vestiges of the terrorists. I wish you all a joyous Christmas.â€</p>

<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">The governorâ€™s message was contained in a statement yesterday in Asaba by his Chief Press Secretary, Charles Aniagwu, wherein he tasked Christians to offer special prayers during the yuletide for greater peace, love, unity, peaceful co-existence and progress of Nigeria.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">Okowa said: â€œI call on all Christians and indeed and all residents in the state to reflect on the virtues and teachings of Jesus Christ in their lives and activities so that Nigeria and indeed the world would be a better place for all of us. I congratulate all Christians for witnessing yet another Christmas season. I advise all of you to use the festive period for sober reflections and total spiritual renewals and devotion towards living in peace and harmony with adherents of other religions.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">â€œThe birth of Jesus Christ being celebrated at Christmas should be used to promote peace, love, understanding and unity, including the display of the spirit of tolerance in the accomplishment of our vision of building a better State and country.â€</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">The governor commended Christian religious leaders and their counterparts of other faiths in the state for conducting themselves peacefully in their religious activities and for joining government in promoting religious and ethnic harmony in the state.</p>

<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;">Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged Nigerians to use this yearâ€™s Christmas to promote love, friendship, peace and reconciliation. In his Christmas Message, Wike said the season exemplifies love, advising that Nigerians should always love one another.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">In a statement by the Special Assistant to the state governor on Electronic Media, Simeon Nwakaudu, he part<span class="s5">icularly urged Riversâ€™ people to use this yearâ€™s Chri</span><span class="s6">stmas to erect platforms of love, peace and reconciliation for the greater development of the state.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">The governor advised the people to pray for the state and the government to enjoy greater peac</span><span class="s7">e in order to consolidate on its developmental programmes that have made the state first among equals.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">He assured the people of the state that he would remain focused in his delivery of pro-people projects and programmes to improve their standard of living.</span></p>
