<p><em>As Pa Akintola Williams is finally laid to rest, the man nicknamed the “Doyen of Accounting</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp;in Nigeria,” who was the first chartered accountant of Nigeria and established the first indigenous chartered accounting</em></p>



<p><em>firm in Africa, is remembered for his outstanding achievements and inspiring personality, writes </em>Vanessa Obioha</p>



<p>On September 11, 2023, a significant date in its own right, Pa Akintola Williams, the revered “father of accounting in Nigeria,” passed away. It was a day that coincided with a historic event, the tragic terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, adding a unique layer of historical significance to his passing. A month later, on October 19, 2023, notable Nigerian personalities gathered at the MUSON Centre in Lagos, not to mourn, but to celebrate the life and legacy of this distinguished figure during his burial ceremony.</p>



<p>The dignitaries, including the governors of Lagos and Ogun states, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Dapo Abiodun respectively, former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, founder of Zenith Bank, Mr. Jim Ovia and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, General Ike Nwachukwu (rtd), filled the Shell Hall of the MUSON Centre as they paid their final respects to the late father of accounting.</p>



<p>In his speech, Sanwo-Olu described the late Williams as an outstanding Nigerian and big Lagosian.</p>



<p>“At 104, how well would you describe a man that God first blessed with a long life and for a very long time, good health, and he had shown leadership at all levels? He was an outstanding Nigerian; a man who took his professional colleagues to an enviable level worldwide.”</p>



<p>Indeed, Pa Williams led a blessed life, having lived for more than a century. The son of colonial service clerk, Thomas Ekundayo Williams, he was born on August 9, 1919, and is recognised as the pioneer of accounting in Nigeria who helped shape the country’s financial sector.</p>



<p>He began his educational journey at Olowogbowo Methodist School and later secured a UAC scholarship to enrol at Yaba Higher College. It was there that he earned a diploma in commerce, paving the way for his illustrious career. Subsequently, Akintola pursued his passion for accounting at the University of London, achieving the esteemed status of a chartered accountant in 1947. Upon his return to Nigeria, he founded Akintola Williams &amp; Co., now known as Deloitte &amp; Touche, in 1952. This historic move marked the establishment of the first indigenous chartered accounting firm in Africa during a time when foreign firms overshadowed their indigenous counterparts.”</p>



<p>The firm would later spread its tentacles across the nation, opening offices in Port Harcourt and Enugu before expanding internationally. Through mergers, the firm grew to become the largest professional services firm in Nigeria by 2004.</p>



<p>President Bola Tinubu in his tribute, described the luminary as an epitome of “integrity, resilience and resourcefulness which was amply demonstrated when he established the first accounting firm, Akintola Williams &amp; Co (Deloitte &amp; Touche) … in 1952.”</p>



<p>The president remarked that the firm would go on to inspire self-confidence in a generation of professionals who would make a further impact in strengthening transparency and competence in the accounting profession.</p>



<p>Williams achieved numerous groundbreaking milestones as a staunch supporter of advancing the accounting profession in Nigeria. He played a pivotal role in founding the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1960 and held the esteemed position of president from 1963 to 1965. His profound influence on ICAN’s evolution was recently acknowledged and celebrated by Dr. Innocent Okwuosa, the current President of ICAN. Okwuosa rightfully recognised Williams as the visionary who provided a nurturing environment for chartered accountants to flourish in Nigeria through the establishment of ICAN.</p>



<p>“This is the least we could do for a man who planted the tree that is providing professional shade for over 60,000 chartered accountants,” he said at a press conference to honour the deceased. “It suffices to say that without his visionary leadership, we may not be here today. He established an institute that has remained a formidable force in the accounting profession not only in Nigeria but globally.”</p>



<p>Williams was also a member of the National Board of Accountants and Auditors. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). His contributions as a member of the National Council of the NSE were instrumental in fostering the growth of the capital market, including the establishment of rules that lowered barriers for companies seeking to list on the exchange. His dedication to these organisations persisted well into his advanced years. Williams held a unique distinction as the last surviving signatory to the original Memorandum and Articles of Association of the NSE, dating back to its inception on September 15, 1960. Additionally, he maintained his status as the last surviving member of the Coker Commission of Enquiry, a commission set up by the late Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa to investigate the finances of the Western Region.</p>



<p>Williams left an indelible mark in public service, where his influence was equally profound. Throughout his lifetime, he occupied various pivotal roles within the public sector. His positions included serving as the chairman of the Federal Income Tax Appeal Commissioners from 1958 to 1968, as a member of the Coker Commission of Inquiry, and as a valuable member of the Board of Trustees of the Commonwealth Foundation from 1966 to 1975. In 1973, he took on the role of chairman for the Lagos state government revenue collection panel.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he chaired several significant corporations, including the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) and assumed a pivotal role as the head of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) audit committee.</p>



<p>Outside of the realm of accounting, Pa Williams made a name for himself in the world of music, with a particular passion for classical compositions. He took on the roles of founder and chairman of the board of Trustees for the Musical Society of Nigeria (MUSON), dedicating his efforts to the promotion of both classical and contemporary music within the country. In a heartfelt tribute to honour his contributions, The MUSON Choir and Orchestra, under the guidance of Dr. Emeka Nwokedi, graced friends, family, stakeholders, and mentees with a musical playlist that showcased the finest pieces of classical music during his wake.</p>



<p>Pa Williams embodied an exemplary life marked by self-discipline and a steadfast commitment to moderation.</p>



<p>“The secret of my longevity is moderation. In everything I do, I strive to be moderate, and I mean moderate, a little of this and a little of that – not too much. Whether it is what you eat, what you drink, or whatever you do, just be moderate and you will live a refreshing, strong, and fulfilling life,” he was quoted as saying in an interview.</p>



<p>He was a role model to many beyond the accounting firm as noted by the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo in his tribute. “When those of us in the military in the province like Kaduna, where I was, came to Lagos in the mid-1960s, we were looking at the likes of Mr. Akintola Williams at a distance with great admiration and in awe,” he said in a statement.</p>



<p>The recurring attributes of the deceased include his calm disposition, spotless scorecard, admirable insights and penchant for accountability and truth.</p>



<p>“His reflections and piercing insights and insistence for truth and accountability cannot but inspire you,” noted Obasanjo. “I often admired his calm&nbsp; disposition and when I asked a friend, ‘Why is he always so calm, composed and methodical?’ He answered, ‘It is because he has a strong internal antenna for controls!’”</p>



<p>For his exceptional lifestyle and achievements, Pa Williams was honoured with the title of Order of the Federal Republic in 1982. In 1997, he received the title of the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for the promotion of arts, culture and music through MUSON from Queen Elizabeth II.</p>



<p>As Nigerians bid the doyen of accounting farewell, there is a clarion call for leaders to emulate his peaceful life and work towards creating a society whose ideals are built on truth and accountability. Okwuosa succinctly captured this as thus:</p>



<p>“We all yearn for a country that works, but Nigeria would work when we all work hard to make it work. We must eschew, as our doyen religiously did, anything that would not contribute to national growth and development.</p>



<p>“As chartered accountants, one way we would immortalise his memory is to continue to advocate for a society where accountability and transparency are the norm rather than the exception.”</p>

It was a day that coincided with a historic event, the tragic terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, adding a unique layer of historical significance to his passing. A month later, on October 19, 2023, notable Nigerian personalities gathered at the MUSON Centre in Lagos, not to mourn, but to celebrate the life and legacy of this distinguished figure during his burial ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dignitaries, including the governors of Lagos and Ogun states, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Dapo Abiodun respectively, former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, founder of Zenith Bank, Mr. Jim Ovia and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, General Ike Nwachukwu (rtd), filled the Shell Hall of the MUSON Centre as they paid their final respects to the late father of accounting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn his speech, Sanwo-Olu described the late Williams as an outstanding Nigerian and big Lagosian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“At 104, how well would you describe a man that God first blessed with a long life and for a very long time, good health, and he had shown leadership at all levels? He was an outstanding Nigerian; a man who took his professional colleagues to an enviable level worldwide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Pa Williams led a blessed life, having lived for more than a century. The son of colonial service clerk, Thomas Ekundayo Williams, he was born on August 9, 1919, and is recognised as the pioneer of accounting in Nigeria who helped shape the country’s financial sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe began his educational journey at Olowogbowo Methodist School and later secured a UAC scholarship to enrol at Yaba Higher College. It was there that he earned a diploma in commerce, paving the way for his illustrious career. Subsequently, Akintola pursued his passion for accounting at the University of London, achieving the esteemed status of a chartered accountant in 1947. Upon his return to Nigeria, he founded Akintola Williams \u0026amp; Co., now known as Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche, in 1952. This historic move marked the establishment of the first indigenous chartered accounting firm in Africa during a time when foreign firms overshadowed their indigenous counterparts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe firm would later spread its tentacles across the nation, opening offices in Port Harcourt and Enugu before expanding internationally. Through mergers, the firm grew to become the largest professional services firm in Nigeria by 2004.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Bola Tinubu in his tribute, described the luminary as an epitome of “integrity, resilience and resourcefulness which was amply demonstrated when he established the first accounting firm, Akintola Williams \u0026amp; Co (Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche) … in 1952.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe president remarked that the firm would go on to inspire self-confidence in a generation of professionals who would make a further impact in strengthening transparency and competence in the accounting profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams achieved numerous groundbreaking milestones as a staunch supporter of advancing the accounting profession in Nigeria. He played a pivotal role in founding the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1960 and held the esteemed position of president from 1963 to 1965. His profound influence on ICAN’s evolution was recently acknowledged and celebrated by Dr. Innocent Okwuosa, the current President of ICAN. Okwuosa rightfully recognised Williams as the visionary who provided a nurturing environment for chartered accountants to flourish in Nigeria through the establishment of ICAN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the least we could do for a man who planted the tree that is providing professional shade for over 60,000 chartered accountants,” he said at a press conference to honour the deceased. “It suffices to say that without his visionary leadership, we may not be here today. He established an institute that has remained a formidable force in the accounting profession not only in Nigeria but globally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams was also a member of the National Board of Accountants and Auditors. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). His contributions as a member of the National Council of the NSE were instrumental in fostering the growth of the capital market, including the establishment of rules that lowered barriers for companies seeking to list on the exchange. His dedication to these organisations persisted well into his advanced years. Williams held a unique distinction as the last surviving signatory to the original Memorandum and Articles of Association of the NSE, dating back to its inception on September 15, 1960. Additionally, he maintained his status as the last surviving member of the Coker Commission of Enquiry, a commission set up by the late Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa to investigate the finances of the Western Region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams left an indelible mark in public service, where his influence was equally profound. Throughout his lifetime, he occupied various pivotal roles within the public sector. His positions included serving as the chairman of the Federal Income Tax Appeal Commissioners from 1958 to 1968, as a member of the Coker Commission of Inquiry, and as a valuable member of the Board of Trustees of the Commonwealth Foundation from 1966 to 1975. In 1973, he took on the role of chairman for the Lagos state government revenue collection panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, he chaired several significant corporations, including the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) and assumed a pivotal role as the head of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) audit committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of the realm of accounting, Pa Williams made a name for himself in the world of music, with a particular passion for classical compositions. He took on the roles of founder and chairman of the board of Trustees for the Musical Society of Nigeria (MUSON), dedicating his efforts to the promotion of both classical and contemporary music within the country. In a heartfelt tribute to honour his contributions, The MUSON Choir and Orchestra, under the guidance of Dr. Emeka Nwokedi, graced friends, family, stakeholders, and mentees with a musical playlist that showcased the finest pieces of classical music during his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePa Williams embodied an exemplary life marked by self-discipline and a steadfast commitment to moderation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The secret of my longevity is moderation. In everything I do, I strive to be moderate, and I mean moderate, a little of this and a little of that – not too much. Whether it is what you eat, what you drink, or whatever you do, just be moderate and you will live a refreshing, strong, and fulfilling life,” he was quoted as saying in an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a role model to many beyond the accounting firm as noted by the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo in his tribute. “When those of us in the military in the province like Kaduna, where I was, came to Lagos in the mid-1960s, we were looking at the likes of Mr. Akintola Williams at a distance with great admiration and in awe,” he said in a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe recurring attributes of the deceased include his calm disposition, spotless scorecard, admirable insights and penchant for accountability and truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“His reflections and piercing insights and insistence for truth and accountability cannot but inspire you,” noted Obasanjo. “I often admired his calm\u0026nbsp; disposition and when I asked a friend, ‘Why is he always so calm, composed and methodical?’ He answered, ‘It is because he has a strong internal antenna for controls!’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor his exceptional lifestyle and achievements, Pa Williams was honoured with the title of Order of the Federal Republic in 1982. In 1997, he received the title of the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for the promotion of arts, culture and music through MUSON from Queen Elizabeth II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Nigerians bid the doyen of accounting farewell, there is a clarion call for leaders to emulate his peaceful life and work towards creating a society whose ideals are built on truth and accountability. Okwuosa succinctly captured this as thus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We all yearn for a country that works, but Nigeria would work when we all work hard to make it work. We must eschew, as our doyen religiously did, anything that would not contribute to national growth and development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“As chartered accountants, one way we would immortalise his memory is to continue to advocate for a society where accountability and transparency are the norm rather than the exception.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","categoryId":7582,"thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screenshot-2023-10-22-at-3.24.40-AM.png","url":"/index.php/2023/10/22/pa-akintola-williams-accomplished-life-of-doyen-of-accounting","tags":[]},"categoryName":"Life
