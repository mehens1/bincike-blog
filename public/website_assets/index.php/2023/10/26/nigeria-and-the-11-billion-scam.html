<p><strong>Verdict By Olusegun Adeniyi</strong></p>



<p>I had just arrived Abuja from Beijing, China on Monday when news broke that Nigeria won its case against Process &amp; Industrial Developments (P&amp;ID) Limited, which had been seeking enforcement of a controversial $11 billion judgement debt in its favour. The Commercial Courts of England and Wales upheld Nigeria’s prayer that the said gas processing contract was obtained by fraud. The judgement affirms the position of Nigeria’s lawyer, Mark Howard, that P&amp;ID obtained the contract “by telling repeated lies and paying bribes to officials.”</p>



<p>While we should rejoice about the court victory, I hope President Bola Tinubu, his Attorney General, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, and other senior officials paid attention to the careful words of Justice Robin Knowles about public service in Nigeria. “This case has also, sadly, brought together a combination of examples of what some individuals will do for money. Driven by greed and prepared to use corruption; giving no thought to what their enrichment would mean in terms of harm for others,” the Judge said before breaking it down for those who may not get his message. “Others that in the present case include the people of Nigeria, already let down in so many ways over the history of this matter by a number of individuals in politics and administration whose duty it was to serve them and protect them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When on 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2020, Sir Ross Cranston of the UK High Court of Justice Queen’s Bench Division Commercial Court granted Nigeria’s application for an extension of time to fight the case based on new evidence, three things became evident. One, had the P&amp;ID promoters and their Nigerian collaborators not been too greedy, they probably would have walked away with about $400 million loot and an oil block. But they insisted on $2 billion and now they have nothing! Two, former Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was instrumental to the temporary reprieve Nigeria secured at the time and should take the credit for Monday’s final judgement. Three, because the P&amp;ID scammers were targeting Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assets, the suspended Governor, Godwin Emefiele, took the lead in the efforts to have the judgement upturned. Unfortunately, when the statement read at the Villa by Fagbemi on Monday was being drafted, according to an impeccable source, it was resolved that credit should not be ascribed to certain individuals. Such pettiness!</p>



<p>Before I come to the role played by Osinbajo and CBN under Emefiele as well as the critical lesson that should serve authorities in Nigeria about this judgement, let me also claim some vindication. I took special interest in the case because this scam was consummated in January 2010 under the administration of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua who was then in a Saudi Arabia hospital. When in my 5<sup>th</sup> September 2019 column, ‘Yar’Adua and the $9.6 Billion Question’ I defended my late principal, I got some angry responses from those I suspected were working for (or at least sympathetic to) the P&amp;ID scammers. The company’s main promoter, the late Michaeal Quinn (who died of cancer in 2015) was known to many top Nigerians and a few believed they should defend him despite overwhelming evidence that he wanted to dupe Nigeria. Now that Justice Knowles has confirmed the whole scheme to be a fraud, I seek the indulgence of readers to rehash excerpts from what I wrote more than four years ago before I conclude.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>=============================================================&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even before receiving inquiries regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;controversial $9.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;judgement that has become a Sword of Damocles over Nigeria, I was already digging to find out what happened.&nbsp;Late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, under whose administration&nbsp;the&nbsp;said contract was signed, is not around to defend himself so I felt an obligation to know&nbsp;the&nbsp;extent of his involvement, if any.&nbsp;The&nbsp;first person I reached out to was Mr Tanimu Yakubu, Yar’Adua’s Chief Economic Adviser&nbsp;and&nbsp;close confidant who also had&nbsp;the&nbsp;gas assignment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my 2011 book, ‘Power Politics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Death’ I wrote: “…It was at&nbsp;the&nbsp;margin of&nbsp;the&nbsp;33rd G8 summit in Germany in June 2007 that&nbsp;the&nbsp;then Russian President, Mr. Vladimir Putin, had a brief chat with Yar’Adua. He bluntly told&nbsp;the&nbsp;president that Nigerian officials were denying a level playing field to Gazprom (the&nbsp;Russian state oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;gas company regarded as&nbsp;the&nbsp;largest extractor of natural gas in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world) which was having difficulties gaining entrance into&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation’s oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;gas industry. Putin told&nbsp;the&nbsp;president he had information that Nigerian government officials, in collaboration with Shell, were deliberately making it impossible for Russian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chinese IOCs to operate in&nbsp;the&nbsp;country. This was a serious allegation that could not be taken lightly. Upon return from&nbsp;the&nbsp;summit,&nbsp;the&nbsp;president directed Tanimu to monitor&nbsp;and&nbsp;provide him with feedback on NNPC&#8217;s proposed partnership with Gazprom until appropriate protocols were signed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following that encounter in Germany, Tanimu travelled to Moscow to open discussions with Russian gas authorities. That he had no idea about this contract is very telling.&nbsp;The&nbsp;then Attorney General&nbsp;and&nbsp;Justice Minister, Mr Michael Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, has also put it on record that he knew nothing about it. Meanwhile, those who served in&nbsp;the&nbsp;administration of&nbsp;the&nbsp;late Yar’Adua knew that when it came to contracts, one man had&nbsp;the&nbsp;last say: Engineer Emeka Ezeh,&nbsp;then Director General of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP). Without a Certificate of No Objection from&nbsp;the&nbsp;BPP, no contract would be awarded. Ezeh, one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;few officials in whom&nbsp;the&nbsp;late Yar’Adua had implicit confidence, told me on Tuesday that he only became aware of&nbsp;the&nbsp;contract when&nbsp;the&nbsp;scandal broke out. He&nbsp;then proceeded to give me a copy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;BPP law&nbsp;and&nbsp;a relevant document which puts a serious&nbsp;question&nbsp;mark on&nbsp;the&nbsp;judgment. ‘The&nbsp;Approved Threshold’ given to&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘Tenders Board&nbsp;and&nbsp;Accounting Officers (Permanent Secretaries&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chief Executive Officers) of all Ministries, Departments&nbsp;and&nbsp;Agencies (MDAs)’ were specific on&nbsp;the&nbsp;amounts that could be approved without recourse to BPP. Under ‘Special Works (NNPC)’, it is stated very clearly that any oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;gas contract that is worth $20 million&nbsp;and&nbsp;above must go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Federal Executive Council (FEC)&nbsp;and&nbsp;secure&nbsp;the&nbsp;BPP Certificate of No Objection before approval.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still do not know&nbsp;the&nbsp;exact sum of this vexatious deal. Yet P&amp;ID was reported to have spent approximately $40 million in pre-contract expenditures.&nbsp;The&nbsp;$9.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;Nigeria is&nbsp;expected to pay is made of a&nbsp;$6.59&nbsp;billion&nbsp;profit&nbsp;the&nbsp;company claims it would have made over a life project of 20 years&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;balance of $3&nbsp;billion&nbsp;accumulated interest since 2012 when&nbsp;the&nbsp;judgement was given. It is interesting that it would take some ‘Oyinbo’ people to teach Nigerians&nbsp;the&nbsp;real meaning of ‘419’!&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;their statement, “P&amp;ID&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nigerian Government entered into a 20-year Agreement – known as&nbsp;the&nbsp;Gas Supply&nbsp;and&nbsp;Processing Agreement (GSPA) – to refine natural gas for powering Nigeria’s electricity grid.&nbsp;The&nbsp;GSPA would have been very profitable for both P&amp;ID&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nigeria&nbsp;and&nbsp;have generated an additional 2,000 megawatts of power for&nbsp;the&nbsp;national grid. Such a major increase in low-cost electricity supply brought by&nbsp;the&nbsp;P&amp;ID project would have been transformative for millions of Nigerians.” Should&nbsp;these extraordinary benefits meant to accrue to&nbsp;the&nbsp;country not have elicited publicity on&nbsp;the&nbsp;day&nbsp;the&nbsp;deal was sealed? Do you sign such a contract in secret with intended beneficiaries, in this case Nigerians, not told of&nbsp;their good fortune?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a damning report published yesterday, &#8216;Is one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;world&#8217;s biggest lawsuits built on a sham?’,&nbsp;Bloomberg Businessweek, a globally respected American weekly business magazine, not only&nbsp;exposed&nbsp;the&nbsp;sordid contract for what it is,&nbsp;but the&nbsp;writers also provided evidence as to why Nigeria must fight it.&nbsp;The&nbsp;intro sums it up: &#8220;A dying Irishman went for one last big score in Nigeria.&nbsp;The&nbsp;project failed, but a London tribunal says his company’s owed $9&nbsp;billion&nbsp;and&nbsp;counting.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;matter has now become complicated. I understand that it was when&nbsp;the&nbsp;claimant, P&amp;ID, appointed&nbsp;their Arbitrator that President Goodluck Jonathan became aware of&nbsp;the&nbsp;issue&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ministry of Petroleum Resources&nbsp;then appointed Mr Bayo Ojo, SAN, a former Attorney General&nbsp;and&nbsp;Justice Minister as a party nominated arbitrator to constitute&nbsp;the&nbsp;Arbitral Tribunal. By&nbsp;the&nbsp;time&nbsp;the&nbsp;sum of $850 million was finally agreed as&nbsp;the&nbsp;term of settlement in May 2015,&nbsp;the&nbsp;government was on its way out. Rather than pay what could have been used against him, Jonathan rightly decided to push&nbsp;the&nbsp;matter to President Muhammadu Buhari.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have it on good authority that&nbsp;the&nbsp;late Yar’Adua never met anybody from P&amp;ID,&nbsp;and&nbsp;this can be easily verified by&nbsp;the&nbsp;current administration. All&nbsp;the&nbsp;records of visitors to&nbsp;the&nbsp;villa are kept. While I concede that some officials might have taken advantage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;president’s illness to breach&nbsp;their fiduciary duties to our country,&nbsp;the&nbsp;insinuation that&nbsp;the&nbsp;fiasco came about because Yar’Adua was in ‘coma’ lacks any substance. Even if he were in Nigeria at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time, presidents don’t sign contracts. That some imaginary Yar’Adua cabal entered&nbsp;the&nbsp;deal is also false. What is clear to me is that&nbsp;P&amp;ID&nbsp;propagandists as well as government officials who dropped&nbsp;the&nbsp;ball are on overdrive because those who would have disputed&nbsp;their claims are dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>There are many things begging for answers here, including&nbsp;the&nbsp;process that led to such ‘agreement’ as well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;terms&nbsp;and&nbsp;conditions.&nbsp;The&nbsp;quantum of&nbsp;the&nbsp;award also raises&nbsp;questions about&nbsp;the&nbsp;integrity of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Arbitral Tribunal. Do you award anticipatory profit recoverable over 20 years, especially when neither risks nor obligations were put on&nbsp;the&nbsp;partner? It is trite to argue that before committing a country to anything that has financial implications,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ministry of Finance,&nbsp;the&nbsp;AGF&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;office of&nbsp;the&nbsp;president must be involved, not just&nbsp;the&nbsp;supervisory ministry. In this case, none was involved. Even if it is Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) must also be involved. It was not, either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever&nbsp;the&nbsp;eventual outcome, we can take certain lessons from&nbsp;the&nbsp;unfortunate saga. One, we must put in place a well-articulated National Arbitration Policy. Two, all pending arbitrations should be reviewed with special attention to&nbsp;the&nbsp;ongoing&nbsp;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) case&nbsp;in Paris concerning&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mambilla Hydroelectric project.&nbsp;Finally, we must institute measures to ensure that Nigerian public officials who sign contracts on behalf of&nbsp;the&nbsp;rest of us do not sell&nbsp;the&nbsp;country cheap. Tying us to scandalous obligations after trading away&nbsp;the&nbsp;jurisdiction for arbitration in case of legal redress is&nbsp;the&nbsp;kind of action that would normally attract capital punishment for erring public officials in some countries!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ENDNOTE:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>In the euphoria of the moment, the Tinubu administration should not get carried away. Over the years, Nigeria has paid billions of Dollars on spurious judgement debts, and I understand many scammers were also waiting in the wings to pounce had we lost this case to the P&amp;ID. What these international crooks (and local collaborators) do is to get some Nigerian public officials, target a thriving sector, sign some dubious ‘agreements’ that are skewed against Nigeria, wait for some time, and then approach the courts for enforcement. That’s how many idle billionaires have been created in the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, after the CBN had been made to deposit $200 million in court in 2020, Emefiele was involved in hiring fresh British lawyers to fight Nigeria’s case. I understand that to date the CBN has expended about $40 million on legal services. The late former Chief of Staff to the president, Abba Kyari and former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu also played critical roles for Nigeria to establish a case of fraud on this transaction. But the main man on this issue is Osinbajo. In his 2020 ruling, Justice Cranston&nbsp;admitted that Osinbajo’s&nbsp;‘fraud on the nation’ declaration in June 2018 turned the table against P&amp;ID in Nigeria’s favour. According to Cranston, Osinbajo’s involvement began in 2017 after he was intimated by the then Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami, SAN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s hear from the Judge: “Following a meeting, on 13 March 2017, Mr Malami wrote to Vice President Osinbajo, who was acting president at the time, exploring five ‘scenarios’ and making recommendations on each. The first was to negotiate a reasonable settlement. The second was to undertake a ‘forensic and extensive examination of the original contract, Award and other Processes to discover loopholes to upset or vary the Award.’ The merits were said to be that a loophole might be discovered, for example, fraud, technical grounds, or a conflict of interest of the arbitrators. The other options were to inquire whether there was the possibility of an appeal, an investigation by the EFCC and a challenge to the recognition and enforcement of the award.”</p>



<p>On 17 March 2017, according to the Judge, Malami wrote another letter to Osinbajo on the earlier scenarios: “Scenario 1 was now expressed as ‘the urgent need’ (emphasis in original) to negotiate a settlement. The scenario about involving the EFCC was that it should be directed to undertake a discreet investigation of the matter, and also to ascertain the personalities and beneficiaries behind P&amp;ID. There was a further letter from Mr Malami to the Vice President dated 29 March 2017. On 6 April 2017 the Vice President approved in manuscript on the letter its proposal to pursue settlement negotiations. There followed on 16 May 2017 (and afterwards) without prejudice settlement discussions with P&amp;ID. After P&amp;ID stated in September 2017 that it intended to enforce the Final Award, on 7 December 2017 the Vice President granted approval to negotiate further. However, settlement negotiations broke down. The Attorney General, Mr Malami, together with then Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Emmanuel Kachikwu wrote to the Vice President on 23 May 2018 in light of US enforcement proceedings which P&amp;ID had initiated, recommending the reopening of negotiations with P&amp;ID while efforts were being made as regards the enforcement proceedings. On 12 June 2018, the Vice President’s office reported that he had agreed with the recommendation and would take up the matter with the President. That same day, 12 June 2018, the Vice President wrote to the President recommending the reopening of negotiations with P&amp;ID. The President approved this recommendation on 26 June 2018.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the offers made to the P&amp;ID promoters failed because they thought they had Nigeria by the balls. According to Justice&nbsp;Cranston, in his minute to the 23 May 2018 joint memo by Malami and Kachikwu, Osinbajo said he considered the transaction ‘a fraud on the nation’, and that there might be “a need to independently review and investigate the entire affair more diligently”. That was the turning point because Osinbajo then recommended to Buhari that the judgement should be challenged. With Emefiele buying into the idea, CBN decided to fund the legal fees.&nbsp;Now that Osinbajo has been vindicated, it is shameful that Fagbemi could not summon the decency to acknowledge the role played by the former vice president. But history will be kind to Osinbajo on the issue. The same goes for the CBN under Emefiele who is currently being punished for his political foolishness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, if there is anything that the P&amp;ID scam has exposed, it is that in the Nigerian deep state, there exists a corps of bureaucrats who specialize in misleading political leaders on technical contracts for their personal gain. The minimum responsibility of the Tinubu government therefore is to expose and prosecute all the traitors who abused their fiduciary duties to the country for illicit gains. Charges should also be filed against the foreign scam artists at P&amp;ID to deter those who have made a career of duping our country. Beyond that, we must begin to build a new culture of ethics in the Nigerian public space.</p>

The Commercial Courts of England and Wales upheld Nigeria’s prayer that the said gas processing contract was obtained by fraud. The judgement affirms the position of Nigeria’s lawyer, Mark Howard, that P\u0026amp;ID obtained the contract “by telling repeated lies and paying bribes to officials.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we should rejoice about the court victory, I hope President Bola Tinubu, his Attorney General, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, and other senior officials paid attention to the careful words of Justice Robin Knowles about public service in Nigeria. “This case has also, sadly, brought together a combination of examples of what some individuals will do for money. Driven by greed and prepared to use corruption; giving no thought to what their enrichment would mean in terms of harm for others,” the Judge said before breaking it down for those who may not get his message. “Others that in the present case include the people of Nigeria, already let down in so many ways over the history of this matter by a number of individuals in politics and administration whose duty it was to serve them and protect them.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen on 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e September 2020, Sir Ross Cranston of the UK High Court of Justice Queen’s Bench Division Commercial Court granted Nigeria’s application for an extension of time to fight the case based on new evidence, three things became evident. One, had the P\u0026amp;ID promoters and their Nigerian collaborators not been too greedy, they probably would have walked away with about $400 million loot and an oil block. But they insisted on $2 billion and now they have nothing! Two, former Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was instrumental to the temporary reprieve Nigeria secured at the time and should take the credit for Monday’s final judgement. Three, because the P\u0026amp;ID scammers were targeting Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assets, the suspended Governor, Godwin Emefiele, took the lead in the efforts to have the judgement upturned. Unfortunately, when the statement read at the Villa by Fagbemi on Monday was being drafted, according to an impeccable source, it was resolved that credit should not be ascribed to certain individuals. Such pettiness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I come to the role played by Osinbajo and CBN under Emefiele as well as the critical lesson that should serve authorities in Nigeria about this judgement, let me also claim some vindication. I took special interest in the case because this scam was consummated in January 2010 under the administration of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua who was then in a Saudi Arabia hospital. When in my 5\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e September 2019 column, ‘Yar’Adua and the $9.6 Billion Question’ I defended my late principal, I got some angry responses from those I suspected were working for (or at least sympathetic to) the P\u0026amp;ID scammers. The company’s main promoter, the late Michaeal Quinn (who died of cancer in 2015) was known to many top Nigerians and a few believed they should defend him despite overwhelming evidence that he wanted to dupe Nigeria. Now that Justice Knowles has confirmed the whole scheme to be a fraud, I seek the indulgence of readers to rehash excerpts from what I wrote more than four years ago before I conclude.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e=============================================================\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven before receiving inquiries regarding\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;controversial $9.6\u0026nbsp;billion\u0026nbsp;judgement that has become a Sword of Damocles over Nigeria, I was already digging to find out what happened.\u0026nbsp;Late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, under whose administration\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;said contract was signed, is not around to defend himself so I felt an obligation to know\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;extent of his involvement, if any.\u0026nbsp;The\u0026nbsp;first person I reached out to was Mr Tanimu Yakubu, Yar’Adua’s Chief Economic Adviser\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;close confidant who also had\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;gas assignment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn my 2011 book, ‘Power Politics\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Death’ I wrote: “…It was at\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;margin of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;33rd G8 summit in Germany in June 2007 that\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;then Russian President, Mr. Vladimir Putin, had a brief chat with Yar’Adua. He bluntly told\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;president that Nigerian officials were denying a level playing field to Gazprom (the\u0026nbsp;Russian state oil\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;gas company regarded as\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;largest extractor of natural gas in\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;world) which was having difficulties gaining entrance into\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;nation’s oil\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;gas industry. Putin told\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;president he had information that Nigerian government officials, in collaboration with Shell, were deliberately making it impossible for Russian\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Chinese IOCs to operate in\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;country. This was a serious allegation that could not be taken lightly. Upon return from\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;summit,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;president directed Tanimu to monitor\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;provide him with feedback on NNPC\u0026#8217;s proposed partnership with Gazprom until appropriate protocols were signed.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing that encounter in Germany, Tanimu travelled to Moscow to open discussions with Russian gas authorities. That he had no idea about this contract is very telling.\u0026nbsp;The\u0026nbsp;then Attorney General\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Justice Minister, Mr Michael Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, has also put it on record that he knew nothing about it. Meanwhile, those who served in\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;administration of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;late Yar’Adua knew that when it came to contracts, one man had\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;last say: Engineer Emeka Ezeh,\u0026nbsp;then Director General of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP). Without a Certificate of No Objection from\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;BPP, no contract would be awarded. Ezeh, one of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;few officials in whom\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;late Yar’Adua had implicit confidence, told me on Tuesday that he only became aware of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;contract when\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;scandal broke out. He\u0026nbsp;then proceeded to give me a copy of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;BPP law\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;a relevant document which puts a serious\u0026nbsp;question\u0026nbsp;mark on\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;judgment. ‘The\u0026nbsp;Approved Threshold’ given to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;‘Tenders Board\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Accounting Officers (Permanent Secretaries\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Chief Executive Officers) of all Ministries, Departments\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Agencies (MDAs)’ were specific on\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;amounts that could be approved without recourse to BPP. Under ‘Special Works (NNPC)’, it is stated very clearly that any oil\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;gas contract that is worth $20 million\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;above must go to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Federal Executive Council (FEC)\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;secure\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;BPP Certificate of No Objection before approval.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe still do not know\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;exact sum of this vexatious deal.

By\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;time\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;sum of $850 million was finally agreed as\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;term of settlement in May 2015,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;government was on its way out. Rather than pay what could have been used against him, Jonathan rightly decided to push\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;matter to President Muhammadu Buhari.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have it on good authority that\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;late Yar’Adua never met anybody from P\u0026amp;ID,\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;this can be easily verified by\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;current administration. All\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;records of visitors to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;villa are kept. While I concede that some officials might have taken advantage of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;president’s illness to breach\u0026nbsp;their fiduciary duties to our country,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;insinuation that\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;fiasco came about because Yar’Adua was in ‘coma’ lacks any substance. Even if he were in Nigeria at\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;time, presidents don’t sign contracts. That some imaginary Yar’Adua cabal entered\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;deal is also false. What is clear to me is that\u0026nbsp;P\u0026amp;ID\u0026nbsp;propagandists as well as government officials who dropped\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;ball are on overdrive because those who would have disputed\u0026nbsp;their claims are dead.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many things begging for answers here, including\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;process that led to such ‘agreement’ as well as\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;terms\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;conditions.\u0026nbsp;The\u0026nbsp;quantum of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;award also raises\u0026nbsp;questions about\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;integrity of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Arbitral Tribunal. Do you award anticipatory profit recoverable over 20 years, especially when neither risks nor obligations were put on\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;partner? It is trite to argue that before committing a country to anything that has financial implications,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Ministry of Finance,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;AGF\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;office of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;president must be involved, not just\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;supervisory ministry. In this case, none was involved. Even if it is Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement,\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) must also be involved. It was not, either.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;eventual outcome, we can take certain lessons from\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;unfortunate saga. One, we must put in place a well-articulated National Arbitration Policy. Two, all pending arbitrations should be reviewed with special attention to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;ongoing\u0026nbsp;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) case\u0026nbsp;in Paris concerning\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;Mambilla Hydroelectric project.\u0026nbsp;Finally, we must institute measures to ensure that Nigerian public officials who sign contracts on behalf of\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;rest of us do not sell\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;country cheap. Tying us to scandalous obligations after trading away\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;jurisdiction for arbitration in case of legal redress is\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;kind of action that would normally attract capital punishment for erring public officials in some countries!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eENDNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the euphoria of the moment, the Tinubu administration should not get carried away. Over the years, Nigeria has paid billions of Dollars on spurious judgement debts, and I understand many scammers were also waiting in the wings to pounce had we lost this case to the P\u0026amp;ID. What these international crooks (and local collaborators) do is to get some Nigerian public officials, target a thriving sector, sign some dubious ‘agreements’ that are skewed against Nigeria, wait for some time, and then approach the courts for enforcement. That’s how many idle billionaires have been created in the country. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, after the CBN had been made to deposit $200 million in court in 2020, Emefiele was involved in hiring fresh British lawyers to fight Nigeria’s case. I understand that to date the CBN has expended about $40 million on legal services. The late former Chief of Staff to the president, Abba Kyari and former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu also played critical roles for Nigeria to establish a case of fraud on this transaction. But the main man on this issue is Osinbajo. In his 2020 ruling, Justice Cranston\u0026nbsp;admitted that Osinbajo’s\u0026nbsp;‘fraud on the nation’ declaration in June 2018 turned the table against P\u0026amp;ID in Nigeria’s favour. According to Cranston, Osinbajo’s involvement began in 2017 after he was intimated by the then Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami, SAN.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s hear from the Judge: “Following a meeting, on 13 March 2017, Mr Malami wrote to Vice President Osinbajo, who was acting president at the time, exploring five ‘scenarios’ and making recommendations on each. The first was to negotiate a reasonable settlement. The second was to undertake a ‘forensic and extensive examination of the original contract, Award and other Processes to discover loopholes to upset or vary the Award.’ The merits were said to be that a loophole might be discovered, for example, fraud, technical grounds, or a conflict of interest of the arbitrators. The other options were to inquire whether there was the possibility of an appeal, an investigation by the EFCC and a challenge to the recognition and enforcement of the award.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 17 March 2017, according to the Judge, Malami wrote another letter to Osinbajo on the earlier scenarios: “Scenario 1 was now expressed as ‘the urgent need’ (emphasis in original) to negotiate a settlement. The scenario about involving the EFCC was that it should be directed to undertake a discreet investigation of the matter, and also to ascertain the personalities and beneficiaries behind P\u0026amp;ID. There was a further letter from Mr Malami to the Vice President dated 29 March 2017. On 6 April 2017 the Vice President approved in manuscript on the letter its proposal to pursue settlement negotiations. There followed on 16 May 2017 (and afterwards) without prejudice settlement discussions with P\u0026amp;ID. After P\u0026amp;ID stated in September 2017 that it intended to enforce the Final Award, on 7 December 2017 the Vice President granted approval to negotiate further. However, settlement negotiations broke down. The Attorney General, Mr Malami, together with then Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Emmanuel Kachikwu wrote to the Vice President on 23 May 2018 in light of US enforcement proceedings which P\u0026amp;ID had initiated, recommending the reopening of negotiations with P\u0026amp;ID while efforts were being made as regards the enforcement proceedings. On 12 June 2018, the Vice President’s office reported that he had agreed with the recommendation and would take up the matter with the President. That same day, 12 June 2018, the Vice President wrote to the President recommending the reopening of negotiations with P\u0026amp;ID. The President approved this recommendation on 26 June 2018.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll the offers made to the P\u0026amp;ID promoters failed because they thought they had Nigeria by the balls. According to Justice\u0026nbsp;Cranston, in his minute to the 23 May 2018 joint memo by Malami and Kachikwu, Osinbajo said he considered the transaction ‘a fraud on the nation’, and that there might be “a need to independently review and investigate the entire affair more diligently”. That was the turning point because Osinbajo then recommended to Buhari that the judgement should be challenged. With Emefiele buying into the idea, CBN decided to fund the legal fees.\u0026nbsp;Now that Osinbajo has been vindicated, it is shameful that Fagbemi could not summon the decency to acknowledge the role played by the former vice president. But history will be kind to Osinbajo on the issue. The same goes for the CBN under Emefiele who is currently being punished for his political foolishness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, if there is anything that the P\u0026amp;ID scam has exposed, it is that in the Nigerian deep state, there exists a corps of bureaucrats who specialize in misleading political leaders on technical contracts for their personal gain. The minimum responsibility of the Tinubu government therefore is to expose and prosecute all the traitors who abused their fiduciary duties to the country for illicit gains. Charges should also be filed against the foreign scam artists at P\u0026amp;ID to deter those who have made a career of duping our country. Beyond that, we must begin to build a new culture of ethics in the Nigerian public space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e• You can follow me on my Twitter handle,\u0026nbsp;@Olusegunverdict\u0026nbsp;and on\u0026nbsp;www.olusegunadeniyi.com\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n","categoryId":7575,"thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screen-Shot-2022-12-08-at-1.06.19-AM.png","url":"/index.php/2023/10/26/nigeria-and-the-11-billion-scam","tags":[]},"categoryName":"Backpage","nextPosts":[{"title":"Moral Clarity of Israel-Hamas War","slug":"moral-clarity-of-israel-hamas-war","date":"2023-10-25T03:29:22","agoDate":"5 months ago","thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/KAYODE-KOMOLAFE.jpg","thumbnail_small":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/KAYODE-KOMOLAFE-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/KAYODE-KOMOLAFE-663x450.jpg","thumbnail_full":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/KAYODE-KOMOLAFE.jpg","excerpt":"","author":null,"category":null,"url":"/index.php/2023/10/25/moral-clarity-of-israel-hamas-war"},{"title":"Taking Children from the Streets to Classrooms","slug":"taking-children-from-the-streets-to-classrooms","date":"2023-10-25T03:29:18","agoDate":"5 months ago","thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Femi-Falana-min.jpg","thumbnail_small":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Femi-Falana-min-150x150.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Femi-Falana-min-800x450.jpg","thumbnail_full":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Femi-Falana-min.jpg","excerpt":"","author":null,"category":null,"url":"/index.php/2023/10/25/taking-children-from-the-streets-to-classrooms"}],"nextCategoryPosts":[],"relatedPosts":[],"categorySlug":"backpage","commentsCount":15,"postTitle":"Nigeria and the $11 Billion Scam","isSponsored":false},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/index.php/[year]/[month]/[day]/[slug]","query":{"year":"2023","month":"10","day":"26","slug":"nigeria-and-the-11-billion-scam"},"buildId":"HBCj11F5MM8ypWRd0mNrs","runtimeConfig":{"WORDPRESS_SITE_URL":"https://content.thisdaylive.com","WORDPRESS_ADMIN_NAME":"darren.openshaw","WORDPRESS_ADMIN_APP_PASSWORD":"\"VH9g 2IX4 KyG9 j52n Gg1A PdNn\"","COOKIEYES_APIKEY":"cc2ad00793bbb3c001d2b9cc","SITE_URL":"https://www.thisdaylive.com","GTAG":"UA-74114574-1"},"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body>
