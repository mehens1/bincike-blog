<p>*<strong>Former president to his kinsmen: Vote massively for Bayelsa gov</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>*<strong>Diri&#8217;s former aide explain why Sylva will win on Saturday’s poll&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa</p>



<p>Former President Goodluck Jonathan has told his kinsmen in Ogbia Local Government Area to reciprocate the good developmental gestures of Governor Douye Diri in the area by massively voting for the governor in Saturday’s governorship poll.<br>Similarly, former Vice President of Nigeria and the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has urged electorate in Kogi State to vote massively for the candidate of the PDP , Senator Melaye on Saturday.</p>



<p><br>Speaking at his country home in Otuoke on Wednesday, when Diri led a delegation to visit the former Nigerian leader, Jonathan said the governor had demonstrated love towards the Ogbia kingdom in different ways and that the people needed to reciprocate this by re-electing him and his deputy, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo.</p>



<p><br>This is coming as a former aide to the Bayelsa State Governor and a leader of ex-militant group in the Niger Delta, &#8216;Gen&#8217;. Charles Kurobo, expressed hope that the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, would carry the day.<br>Kurobo said the people of Bayelsa were tired of the failed promises of the successive PDP-led administrations in Bayelsa.<br>Jonathan commended Diri for choosing one of his political sons, Chief Mitema Obordor, as Director-General of his governorship campaign council, stating that it was a signal of more good things to come to the East Senatorial District of the state.</p>



<p><br>He said: “I thank the Otuoke community for giving the governor and his team this warm reception. For us in this senatorial district, one thing we should know is that when somebody picks one of your own to lead him in a political contest, that means that person will never forget you.</p>



<p><br>“For the governor to select Obordor from this senatorial district and indeed from Ogbia as his campaign DG, it means that Governor Diri has the mind to do something for you and will not forget you. And I plead with you all to reciprocate so we can get the benefit in store for us.”<br>He urged the people to renew the governor’s mandate on Saturday by voting massively for him.<br>In his remarks, Diri thanked the former president and his wife, Dame Patience Jonathan, for the warm reception and his endorsement, which he said was given freely.</p>



<p><br>Diri, described Jonathan as a unique democrat and patriot that always desired the best for the state and the country.<br>He also stated that Jonathan had always been a father to all and not a political godfather.<br>Diri, said those speculating that his endorsement by the former president and the former governor, Senator Seriake Dickson, was due to godfatherism were either ignorant or being mischievous.</p>



<p><br>He stressed that they lacked the understanding of honouring those placed in position to lift others like Jonathan and Dickson.<br>His words: “I have had the endorsement of the immediate past governor of the state. Today, I also have been endorsed by the former president of the country, who happens to be our own, and some people say that is godfatherism. I say a thousand times No. We must honour those that God has placed in position.<br>“Let me make it clear that the former president has never asked me for anything. Some ignorant people were writing on social media that it was because of what the governor is giving to the former president. That is ignorant and very mischievous.</p>



<p><br>“If there is anything that I convinced myself to do, I support him out of my conviction. The same thing with the immediate past governor. We must recognise our leaders because if we do not, when it comes to your turn, nobody will support you.”<br>Diri recalled that his relationship with Jonathan dates back to when the former president was deputy governor and later governor of the state and that he alongside Dickson served under Jonathan as commissioners.</p>



<p><br>It was the second time in 24 hours that the former president endorsed the governor’s second term bid, coming immediately after prominent leaders of the PDP, including governors, former governors, National Assembly members as well as members of the National Working Committee visited him on Tuesday at his Yenagoa residence</p>



<p><br>However, in statement yesterday, Kurobo, who was a former SSA to Diri, noted that Bayelsans yearn for infrastructural and socio-economic development which the current administration had failed to deliver.<br>He appealed to Bayelsa electorate to turn out in their number and cast their votes for the candidate of the APC, Chief Sylva.<br>Kurobo, who recently dumped the PDP for the APC, noted that the ruling national party, APC was better positioned to offer the people of the state that change they are yearning for.</p>



<p><br>He expressed dismay over the situation where some elders and leaders of the party were still sitting on the fence at the dying minutes of the election when they ought to mobilise for the party’s candidate.<br>Meanwhile, Atiku has urged electorate to vote massively for Melaye in Kogi State.<br>Atiku, made the call while addressing large crowd of &nbsp;supporters of the PDP at the grand finale of the gubernatorial election campaign in Lokoja.<br>He explained that the time had come for the PDP to regain power and occupy Lugard House in Lokoja .</p>



<p><br>He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t allow yourself to be threatened. We know what happened in the last four years. They refused to allow us to use the stadium for our campaign but they can&#8217;t stop us from voting&#8221;.<br>“We are not afraid of their threats, for the sake of Kogi State, vote for Dino Melaye and Habeebat Deen so that Kogi State will be rescued from this hardship.<br>&#8220;I am appealing to INEC and the security agencies to conduct a free and fair election and ensure that our votes count.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am aware that our people coming from Kogi Central have been blocked from entering Lokoja. We are praying for them. Don&#8217;t allow that to discourage you. Come out and vote on Saturday, your safety is guaranteed,&#8221; he added.<br>While speaking at the event, the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, Sen. Philip Tenimu Aduda, urged members of the PDP to defy the threats and vote for their party to Liberate Kogi State from the bad governance ravaging the state.</p>



<p><br>He said &#8220;We have suffered enough in the hands of the present government. Many people are dying of hunger and so much poverty. There is hunger in the land and this is the time to liberate our state and take our destinies in our hands. We have just one Kogi and One Destiny.&#8221;<br>In his remark, the former governor of Kogi State, Captain Idris Wada expressed confidence that despite the challenges facing the PDP, the party would emerge victorious.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;The day has come for you to speak to your leaders. You have an opportunity to choose the person that will be in charge of your state.<br>PDP will improve agriculture and create employment for the people.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will improve education because the candidate we have is well packaged and well experienced in good governance. I urge you to vote for PDP so that happiness will return to Kogi state&#8221;.</p>

Today, I also have been endorsed by the former president of the country, who happens to be our own, and some people say that is godfatherism. I say a thousand times No. We must honour those that God has placed in position.\u003cbr\u003e“Let me make it clear that the former president has never asked me for anything. Some ignorant people were writing on social media that it was because of what the governor is giving to the former president. That is ignorant and very mischievous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“If there is anything that I convinced myself to do, I support him out of my conviction.
