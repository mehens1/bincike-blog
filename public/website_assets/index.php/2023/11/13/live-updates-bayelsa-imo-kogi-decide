<p><strong>MONDAY 13, NOVEMBER 2023</strong></p>



<p><strong>2:34pm</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>Diri Wins Southern Ijaw LG</p>



<p>Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Governor Douye Diri, has won the governorship election in Southern Ijaw LGA, polling 24,685 votes.</p>



<p>In the results announced at the State Collation Centre&nbsp; in Yenagoa Monday, his closest rival, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Timipre Sylva, scored 18,174&nbsp;votes.</p>



<p>The Labour Party candidate, Udengs Eradiri, scored 119 votes.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1:11pm</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sylva Wins Brass, as Collation Resumes in Bayelsa</strong></p>



<p>The collation of the governorship election results in Bayelsa resumed Monday afternoon with the announcement of the results from Brass Local Government Area won by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Timipre Sylva, who scored 18,431 votes.</p>



<p>His closest rival, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Governor Douye Diri, polled 12,602 votes, while that of the Labour Party, Udengs Eradiri, scored 83 votes.</p>



<p><strong>12:52pm</strong></p>



<p>Collation of Governorship Election Results Under way in Yenogoa</p>



<p><strong>7:00am</strong></p>



<p><strong>Uzodimma, Ododo Win Imo, Kogi, Diri Leads in Bayelsa</strong></p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Opposition candidates call for cancellation of elections</strong></p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Yiaga Africa alleges INEC uploaded results for PUs where elections didn’t hold</strong></p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>HURIWA: exercise viciously rigged, full of violence</strong></p>



<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Advises losers not to waste money challenging results</strong></p>



<p><em>Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja, Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa, James Sowole in Abeokuta and Tony Icheku in Owerri</em></p>



<p>Saturday’s off-cycle governorship elections in Imo, Bayelsa and Kogi states are gradually coming to a close, with the declaration, yesterday, of Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma, the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), and the APC candidate in Kogi State, Usman Ahmed Ododo, as winners by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>



<p>Although the exercises had yet to conclude in Bayelsa State and some parts of Kogi State, results so far declared by the electoral body also showed that the governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, was already leading with comfortable margin.</p>



<p>But the opposition candidates across the three states, where elections were held, rejected the results released and subsequently called for their cancellation, particularly, in Imo and Kogi states, where Uzodimma and Ododo had been returned elected.</p>



<p>The objections came as Yiaga Africa, a civil society organisation (CSO), asked INEC to clarify the status of locations, where voting did not hold in the off-cycle polls, yet results were announced.</p>



<p>At the same time, a pro-democracy and civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), condemned the spate of violence, armed political thuggery, and electoral heists that characterised Saturday’s elections.</p>



<p>HURIWA, therefore, advised losers that it would amount to a waste and misuse of resources to file cases before the election petitions tribunal because the judiciary could no longer guarantee justice.</p>



<p>Returning Officer for the Imo State governorship election, and Vice Chancellor, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Professor Abayomi Fasina, announced the results yesterday morning at the state collation centre in Owerri, the state capital.</p>



<p>Fasina declared Uzodimma winner of the election with 540,308 votes. He announced that Senator Samuel Anyanwu of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came a distant second with 71,503 votes, while Senator Athan Achonu of Labour Party (LP) polled 64,081 votes to come third.</p>



<p>Fasina declared, “That the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Good Hope Uzodimma, having scored the highest number of votes and satisfied the requirements of the law, is hereby declared the winner of the election and returned elected.”</p>



<p>In Kogi, from the 18 local government areas results already declared, the APC candidate, Ododo, who was declared winner, polled 446,237 votes, while the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate, Murtala Ajaka, trailed behind with 259,052 votes.</p>



<p>The PDP candidate, Dino Melaye, scored a paltry 46,362 votes, while his counterpart in African Democratic Party (ADP) got 21,819 votes.</p>



<p>The returning officer, Professor Johnson Urama of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, announced the results late last night at the state collation centre in Lokoja.</p>



<p>“Ahmed Ododo, having certified the requirements of the law, is hereby declared winner and returned elected,” Urama declared.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, INEC said collation of the remaining results will continue in Kogi State today, as scheduled.</p>



<p>The local government areas, where election results had been collated and declared included Adavi, Ajaokuta, Ankpa, Bassa, Dekina, Idah, Ijumu, Kabba-Bunu, Kogi, Mopamuro, Ofu, Okehi, Okene, Olamaboro, Omala, Yagba East, and Yagba West. The results from only one ward in Ogori Magongo Local Government Area was received and announced.</p>



<p>The APC candidate won in 11 local government areas, out of the 18 declared so far, namely, Adavi, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ijumu, Kabba-Bunu, Kogi, Mopamuro, Ogori Magongo, Okehi, Okene, and Yagba West. The SDP candidate won in Ankpa, Idah, Dekina, Ofu, Olamaboro and Omala local government areas, while the ADC candidate, Leke Abejide, won in Yagba East Local Government Area.</p>



<p>Speaking to newsmen shortly after the results were announced, the agent of SDP, Mr Ohemoyi David, expressed disappointment with the way INEC went ahead to announce the result, in spite of some abnormalities witnessed during the election.</p>



<p>David said, “We have written a petition to INEC on the election, yet it went ahead to announce the result, even when it has pledged to conduct supplementary election in some LGAs on November 18.</p>



<p>“We shall definitely challenge this action in court.”</p>



<p>However, the incumbent governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, expressed gratitude to residents of the state for giving Ododo the opportunity to take over from him on January 27, 2024.</p>



<p>Bello also thanked INEC, security operatives, and the media for ensuring that the election was a success. He assured the public that Ododo would not fail in continuing with the efforts to transform the state.</p>



<p>Ododo thanked the people for counting him worthy to lead them in the next phase of leadership. The governor-elect declared himself as “the people’s servant”, who was ready to serve them faithfully for the growth and development of Kogi State.</p>



<p>Reacting to his own victory, Uzodimma declared his re-election a vindication that he was the real winner of the same election in 2019, when he wrested the mandate through the courts.</p>



<p>Speaking at Government House Chapel, Owerri, after Mass, the governor expressed how happy and thankful he was to God for making it possible for him to win overwhelmingly in the governorship election.</p>



<p>He recalled how he was denied victory in 2019, as some people conspired to remove his votes from 388 polling units, a situation that made him to embark on a tortuous court process that ended at the Supreme Court. The apex court ruled in his favour and restored his mandate on January 15, 2020.</p>



<p>Uzodimma stated, “My good people of Imo State, I am humbled and honoured by your overwhelming support in yesterday’s (Saturday’s) election. Your trust in me to continue leading our dear state is both inspiring and deeply appreciated. Together, we have achieved a resounding victory and I am committed to delivering on the promises made during our campaign.</p>



<p>“As we embark on the next level of Shared Prosperity, rest assured that your interests will remain at the forefront of my administration. I extend a hand to my fellow contenders from other parties, urging them to join me in a united effort to build and uplift our one and only dear state. In the spirit of inclusivity, we will operate a government that transcends political differences for the benefit of all.</p>



<p>“I express profound gratitude to every member of my team, our great party and every citizen of Imo for your unwavering support. Our state is progressing because of your collective efforts. I commend the INEC and its officials for ensuring a fair and neutral electoral process. I also appreciate the dedication of the security agencies in maintaining peace during the exercise.</p>



<p>“A special thanks to the leader of our great party, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for his fatherly guidance throughout the electioneering period. Together, let us continue the journey towards a more prosperous and inclusive lmo state. Thank you, Ndi Imo, for your trust and confidence. Our shared future is bright and I am committed to leading us to greater heights.”</p>



<p>But LP’s Achonu, who first rejected the results of the election, said there was no election, but a rape of democracy.</p>



<p>Addressing a press conference, the LP flagbearer alleged that the security agencies, including the Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police, and military raped the nation’s democracy.</p>



<p>He said, “It was like a coup by the security agencies. It was not the fault of INEC, they were scared. When you see the security agencies doing the bidding of government in a state where they behead people like chicken, what do you do?</p>



<p>“We are only waiting for INEC chairman to tell us why he didn’t stop the collation because you cannot have a collation when what you have on your results sheet is different from what you have on IReV.</p>



<p>“INEC told the whole world that BVAS will work that BVAS will be used for accreditation. 70% of the voting yesterday was done without BVAS accreditation, yet the result was announced.</p>



<p>“These things were taken to the homes of commissioners, sole administrators of LGA and traditional rulers. I call on all ad hoc staff of INEC with evidence of what happened to come forward and expose them.</p>



<p>“In Orsu LGA, they brought foreigners to vote; an ARISE TV reporter was beaten in a commissioner’s house. It is a rape on democracy. We are going to court. The state chairman of LP was brutalised.</p>



<p>“There was no election. They promised us to do the ward collation at designated collation centres, but they took it to the LG HQ and very few to INEC designated centres, and when they got to the LG HQ, they only allowed APC commissioners, and LG sole administrators, and the security barred every other person, you can imagine what went on there.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the deputy governorship candidate of LP, Tony Nwulu, alleged at a press conference that security agents provided cover for some persons as they subverted the will of the people, declaring that LP won with the actual votes cast in the election.</p>



<p>While noting that “democracy is under threat in this state,” Nwulu insisted, “There was no election in Imo State on Saturday. What happened was the diversion of the electoral materials to the homes of people and the LGA council headquarters. In all this, the police, Army and the DSS provided security to the actors.</p>



<p>“They came with huge sums of money to the polling units for votes-buying but the Imo people rejected them. They now resorted to snatching of electoral materials, diversion of the electoral materials to homes of individuals and to the LGA headquarters, where they are currently rewriting the results.</p>



<p>“We have all the records. We are putting Nigerians on notice that there was no election in Imo State on Saturday. The position of our party and my principal, Senator Athan Achonu, who is the governorship candidate of the party is that this sham called election be cancelled.”</p>



<p>The PDP governorship candidate, Anyanwu, also heaped the blame on the security agencies that stayed with the INEC staff as the APC members were busy thumb-marking the ballot papers.</p>



<p>Addressing journalists at a press conference, Anyanwu, who also called for cancellation of the election, said INEC and security agents failed in their constitutional responsibility to deliver credible elections to the people of the state. He alleged that the security agents protected INEC staff as the APC members rewrote the results, stressing that he and his party, PDP, would not accept anything less than a total cancellation of the poll.</p>



<p><strong>Diri Leads With Wide Margin, Collations Continues</strong></p>



<p>The PDP candidate in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, was leading with 138, 009 votes, while Chief Timipre Sylva of APC trailed with 74, 255 votes in six out of the eight local government areas of the state declared yesterday.</p>



<p>INEC, yesterday, postponed the collation and announcement of results from the remaining two local governments till noon today.</p>



<p>Returning Officer, Farouk Kuta, who is also Vice Chancellor of Federal University, Minna, said the postponement was as a result of the challenges and difficulties in the collation in some of the units in two of the most difficult areas to reach in the state.</p>



<p>In the results released so far, PDP won in five local government areas, while APC won in one.</p>



<p>The local government areas so far announced were Kolokuma/Opokuma, Yenagoa, Ogbia, Sagbama, Nembe, and Ekeremor, while the results from Brass and Southern Ijaw local government areas were yet to be declared before INEC suspended the collation.</p>



<p>According to the results announced so far, PDP scored 37,777 votes while APC got 14,534 votes in Yenagoa while in Kolokuma/Opokuma PDP got 18,465 votes and APC got 5349 votes.</p>



<p>PDP polled 18,435 votes in Ogbia while APC scored 16,319 votes; PDP secured 35,504 votes in Sagbama with APC having 6608 votes; PDP had 23,172 votes in Ekeremor, APC scored 8445 while in Nembe, APC polled 22,248 votes while PDP got 4,556 votes.</p>



<p>Sylva had suffered a huge set back following the cancellation of over 26,000 votes purportedly recorded in Ward 11,12 and 13 of Mini, Ikensi and Oluasiri in Nembe Local Government Area.</p>



<p>The cancellation followed protest by stakeholders, particularly members of PDP, over the alleged hijack of election materials by suspected APC thugs in Nembe-Bassambiri and refusal to allow voters, including supporters of PDP, to cast their votes.</p>



<p>PDP also alleged that most of the votes purportedly recorded by the APC in the area were cooked and were voodoo votes that should be cancelled. The votes from Mini, Ikensi and Oluasiri communities were cancelled after the INEC officials reviewed the PDP arguments.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there was a massive protest at the headquarters of the commission by PDP stakeholders, calling for cancellations of results in Nembe and Brass local government areas of the Bayelsa East Senatorial District. While the protest was going on, reports came that a PDP supporter was hacked to death by suspected APC supporters in Brass Local Government Area.</p>



<p>The middle aged man, identified as George Sibo, was reportedly hacked down in the afternoon after he was attacked by a mob.</p>



<p>Some eyewitnesses claimed the deceased, a supporter of the PDP, was attacked at the Governorship Election Collation Centre at the local government area headquarters when results for some wards in Constituency 2 were being submitted.</p>



<p>When contacted by our reporter, the Bayelsa State lawmaker representing Brass Constituency-one, Dr. Daniel Charles, condemned the gruesome murder by people he described as desperate power seekers and urged security agents to immediately arrest and prosecute perpetrators of the dastardly act.</p>



<p>The deceased, popularly called “Kobo-Kobo”, was said to be an indigene of Twon-Brass and aide to the Brass Local Government Chairman, Hanson Alabo-Karika.</p>



<p>In a related development, the Bayelsa State chapter of PDP accused Sylva in the alleged hostage-taking of an officials of INEC in Twon-Brass, headquarters of Brass Local Government Area.</p>



<p>The party, in a statement issued by its publicity secretary, Ebiye Ogoli, alleged that the APC candidate stormed the INEC office on the Brass Island yesterday in a bid to manipulate the result of the governorship election in the local government area.</p>



<p><strong>Melaye, Others Seeks Cancellation of Kogi Guber Election</strong></p>



<p>The candidate of PDP in Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State, Senator Dino Melaye, called for the total cancellation of the election following alleged massive rigging aided by INEC.</p>



<p>Melaye made the call at a press conference in Lokoja on Sunday, condemning the conduct of election in Kogi State in totality.</p>



<p>Describing the exercise as shameful and unhealthy, he regretted that INEC had not learnt any lessons to realise, ameliorate and palliate the problem they created in the democratic process during the general election, and still repeated the same in the governorship election.</p>



<p>Melaye stated, “Yesterday, in the five local governments of Central Senatorial district in Kogi State, there was no election in the end. Surprisingly, accreditation was done manually. The BVAS was not used. Prepared sheets manifested even before accreditation and evidence is all over media.</p>



<p>“INEC, as matter of urgency, must cancel the election. Many areas where I won, my agents were told there were no available result sheets to enter the results and we have evidence to back up this claims</p>



<p>“As I speak to you, it is shameful that this is what our democracy has descended to. INEC has manifested ever than before, that they cannot be trusted; they are biased; they are compromised and they cannot be neutral umpire.”</p>



<p>The Kogi State chapter of SDP also called for the cancellation of results of the November 11 governorship election in the state.</p>



<p>SDP made this call at the gubernatorial election collation centre, where the party’s collation agent, David Edibu, submitted a petition to INEC, calling for cancellation of results in Okene, Okehi, Ogori Magongo, Adavi, Ajaokuta local government areas as well as some parts of Lokoja, alleging corrupt practices, vote-buying and over-voting.</p>



<p>Edibu added that agents of SDP were not allowed to get close to the polling units in the local government areas.</p>



<p>The state returning officer, Professor Johnson Urame, received the petitions on behalf of the commission and assured the party that they would be reviewed.</p>



<p>PDP keyed into the petition of SDP. The PDP collation agent, Abubakar Mahmood, added that the rate of malpractices in the said council areas was alarming.</p>



<p>But APC, while reacting to the calls for cancellation, said PDP could not blame anyone for not bringing agents to the polling units.</p>



<p>The governorship candidate of Labour Party (LP) in the state, Adejoh Okeme, urged Nigerians to save the nation’s democracy, even as he called for nullification of results from the central senatorial district.</p>



<p>In a statement by the state publicity secretary, Idakwo Emmanuel, Okeme called on the election management body to uphold justice and nullify the elections in Okene, Okehi, Adavi and Ogori Magongo. He stressed that the results from those areas were characterised by massive malpractices, including filling of result sheets before commencement of the voting process, vote buying, over voting and ballot box snatching in favour of the ruling APC.</p>



<p>He warned that any attempt to admit the cooked-up results from such areas was total sabotage of the will of the people.</p>



<p>Okeme said, “INEC must stand tall to counter the dubious moves of the ruling party and deliver on its promises to the people, which is free, fair and credible election.</p>



<p>“We must do the right thing and stop the intimidation of opposition with the recent made up cliché, ‘Go to Court’, as the integrity of our judiciary has been greatly reduced by sheer political issues. The will of the people must be allowed to succeed.”</p>



<p><strong>Kogi: INEC Holds Fresh Elections in Affected Areas</strong></p>



<p>INEC, yesterday, announced that fresh elections would be held on Saturday, November 18, in some Polling Units in Kogi State, where voting was suspended.</p>



<p>Some staff of the commission were caught with already filled result sheets while election was still ongoing, which led to the suspension of election in the affected polling units.</p>



<p>INEC National Commissioner and Member, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mohammed Haruna, in a statement, said the resolution of the commission was in line with Section 24(3) of the Electoral Act 2022 and Clause 59 of INEC Regulations and Guidelines on the Conduct of Elections 2022.</p>



<p>Haruna said, “Further to our statement yesterday, we have received an update from our Kogi State office regarding the suspension of election in some locations in the state, where result sheets were completed before the commencement of voting.”</p>



<p>Haruna noted that the most critical incident occurred in nine out of 10 Wards in Ogori/Magongo Local Government Area, and stressed that the commission also received reports of similar and other incidents in Adavi — five Polling Units in Okunchi/Ozuri/Onieka Ward; Ajaokuta — five Polling Units in Adogo Ward; Okehi — one Polling Unit in Eika/Ohizenyi Ward; and Okene — five Polling Units in Obehira Uvete Ward.</p>



<p>The national commissioner noted that results from the affected polling units had been accounted for in Form EC40G for the four local government areas.</p>



<p>He stated, “However, in the case of Ogori/Magongo LGA, only the result of Oshobane Ward II with eight Polling Units and 2,264 registered voters has been collated. Election in the other nine Wards (Eni, Okibo, Okesi, Ileteju, Aiyeromi, Ugugu, Obinoyin, Obatgben and Oturu) involving 59 Polling Units and 15,136 registered voters remain suspended.</p>



<p>“In line with Section 24(3) of the Electoral Act 2022 and Clause 59 of INEC Regulations and Guidelines on the Conduct of Elections 2022, fresh election will be held on Saturday 18th November 2023 in the affected Polling Units.”</p>



<p>Haruna noted that the decision to hold fresh elections was subject to the Returning Officer’s determination of the application of the Margin of Lead Principle. He explained that this decision was without prejudice to the commission’s avowed commitment to follow the audit trail of personnel and materials to ascertain those who might have been complicit in undermining the process and apply appropriate sanctions where necessary.</p>



<p><strong>APC Urges INEC to Protect Integrity of Votes in Kogi</strong></p>



<p>The leadership of APC called on INEC to protect the integrity of the legitimate votes of the Kogi electorate.</p>



<p>National Publicity Secretary of the party, Felix Morka, in a statement, said the announced and uploaded results, so far, showed the party’s candidate maintained a landslide lead in Kogi West and Central, with a competitive showing in Kogi East.</p>



<p>Morka stated, “With the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Usman Ododo, coasting to spectacular victory in Saturday’s Kogi guber election, we call on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to protect the integrity of the legitimate votes of the Kogi electorate.</p>



<p>“We are keenly aware of intense pressure, including violent threats on INEC staff, by agents and supporters of trailing opposition parties aimed at unduly influencing or disrupting ongoing collation of results in the state.”</p>



<p>The ruling party urged INEC to stand firm in discharge of its constitutional duty to deliver free, fair and credible election in the state, and ensure that the freely exercised will of the Kogi electorate prevailed.</p>



<p><strong>HURIWA: Elections Viciously Rigged, Full of Violence</strong></p>



<p>Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) condemned the spate violence, armed political thuggery, and electoral heists that characterised Saturday’s off-cycle elections in Imo, Bayelsa and Kogi states.</p>



<p>HURIWA regretted that despite the assurances by the service chiefs, including the National Security Adviser (NSA), Malam Nuhu Ribadu, that there would be peaceful and law-based polls, the opposite was the case in Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa.</p>



<p>It alleged that ballots boxes were cruelly snatched and in Imo State, armed police operatives were participants in the violent snatching of ballots boxes.</p>



<p>The rights group cited the example of the citizens’ arrest of a uniformed senior police officer in Ikeduru, Imo State, who was caught by youths of the community carting ballots boxes away and handed him over to the police.</p>



<p>In a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA condemned the security forces in Imo State, who allegedly supervised the violence unleashed on the Labour Party (LP) agent in Imo State, Calistus Ihejiagwa. Ihejiagwa was reportedly beaten and bundled out of the state Collation Centre in Owerri, the state capital.</p>



<p>HURIWA, however, held the opinion that it would amount to time wasting and misuse of resources for politicians, who lost in the elections, to file cases before the election petitions tribunal because the judiciary was unable to dispense justice.</p>



<p><strong>Yiaga Africa: INEC Uploaded Results in PUs Without Polls</strong></p>



<p>A civil society organisation (CSO), Yiaga Africa, asked INEC to clarify the status of locations where voting did not hold in the off-cycle polls, yet results were announced.</p>



<p>Through its Watching The Vote (WTV) initiative, Yiaga said its observers in Imo State said elections did not take place in 12 per cent of sampled polling units, and stressed that the cases were prevalent in Orsu, Okigwe, Oru East, and Orlu local government areas.</p>



<p>Yiaga said it monitored the upload of results on the IReV, especially, those from polling units where elections did not hold.</p>



<p>For Orsu Local Government Area in Imo State, Yiaga Africa’s WTV reported that the election did not take place in nine sampled polling units. There were speculations that INEC might have relocated all polling units to the local government headquarters on election day.</p>



<p>Yiaga Africa said voters in Orsu Local Government Area were not informed of the change in polling unit location and INEC failed to issue an official statement on the supposed temporary relocation of polling units.</p>



<p>In Okigwe Local Government Area in Imo State, Yiaga Africa observers reported that elections did not take place in eight sampled polling units.</p>



<p>It stated, “In Oru East LGA, the election was not held in eight of Yiaga Africa’s sampled polling units. In addition, elections were not held in seven of our sampled polling units in Orlu LGA and in one (1) of our sampled polling units each in Ideato North, Ikeduru, Oru West and Owerri West LGAs.”</p>



<p>It called on INEC to investigate these scenarios, saying, “Yiaga is concerned with the upload of results form EC8A for some of the sampled polling units, where elections were not conducted in Orsu, Oru East, Oru West, Ideato North, Ikeduru and Okigwe LGAs on the IreV.</p>



<p>“To ensure transparency and to protect the integrity of the process, Yiaga Africa calls on the INEC to clarify the status of voting across polling units in Orsu, Okigwe, Oru East and Orlu LGAs in Imo state.</p>



<p>“Additionally, INEC should investigate the report of likely election malpractices in these polling units, especially for locations where results have been uploaded on the IReV without the conduct of accreditation and voting.”</p>



<p><strong>Party Agents Created Chaos, Alleges EU Group</strong></p>



<p>The European Union (EU) observers group protecting the rights of Persons With Disabilities (PWDs), TAF Africa, stated that some political party agents created chaos and disorderliness in different polling units during the Saturday governorship election in Bayelsa State in an attempt to induce the PWDs through vote buying. They urged INEC to heighten vigilance and enforcement of electoral laws to maintain a free and fair electoral environment in the future exercise.</p>



<p>Speaking with newsmen in Yenagoa on Sunday, Chief Executive Officer and founder, TAF Africa, convener, disability inclusion Nigeria, Amb. Jake Epelle, said there was a positive development on the part of INEC, on the overall experience of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) during the 2023 off-cycle election, in contrast to the general election held earlier in the year.</p>



<p>Represented by the team leader to Bayelsa governorship election, Mr Muyiwa Aderibigbe, Epelle said the specific assistive tools, including the Braille ballot guide for the blind, large graphic posters for the deaf, and magnifying glasses for persons with albinism were deployed by INEC.</p>



<p>He said, “TAF Africa notes with concern the recorded incident of PWD voter inducement in the off-cycle states. For instance, in St. Luke Sec School, Agudama Epie polling unit, Epie Ward 1, Yenagoa LGA of Bayelsa State, some party agents engaged in vote buying, thereby causing chaos and disorderliness in the polling unit.</p>



<p>“This challenges the integrity of the electoral process and emphasises the need for heightened vigilance and enforcement of electoral laws to maintain a free and fair electoral environment.</p>



<p>“With a team of 30 trained observers deployed in each state, particularly in polling units with the highest number of registered persons with disabilities, our primary focus was evaluating the compliance of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) with the deployment of assistive tools for persons with disabilities, access to priority voting in line with the electoral act as well as the overall experience of persons with disabilities at the polls.</p>



<p>“In a positive development, there was a notable improvement in the participation and overall experience of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) during the 2023 off-cycle election, in contrast to the general election held earlier in the year.</p>



<p>“TAF Africa acknowledges the efforts made by INEC in enhancing accessibility and inclusivity for PWDs in the electoral process. We acknowledge the commendable efforts made by INEC to enhance the participation and overall experience of PWDs in the 2023 off-cycle election.”</p>



<p><strong>Akpabio, Abiodun, Kalu Congratulate Uzodinma</strong></p>



<p>President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio; Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun; and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, congratulated the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, on his victory in last Saturday’s governorship election.</p>



<p>Akpabio, in a congratulatory letter, hailed Uzodinma for his resilience and commitment to genuine democratic practices, saying, “Good governance has triumphed over propaganda.”</p>



<p>He stated, “Your Excellency, I wish to heartily congratulate and rejoice with you and the people of Imo State on your well-deserved re-election as the Executive Governor of Imo state. Your victory is a testimony of your excellent performance in office in the last four years.</p>



<p>“I must say, this victory is an affirmation by Ndi Imo of your sterling leadership qualities and confirmation of your outstanding performance and delivery of the dividends of democracy to the people.”</p>



<p>Abiodun expressed delight that the resounding victory of Uzodinma attested to his leadership quality and delivery of the dividends of democracy to the people. He also praised President Bola Tinubu and INEC for the hitch-free electoral process in Imo, Bayelsa and Kogi states on Saturday.</p>



<p>The governor stated, “On behalf of the people of Ogun State, I will like to extend my warmest congratulations on your re-election as the Governor of Imo State. Your resounding victory is a testament to the trust and confidence that the people of Imo State have in your ability to lead them towards progress and prosperity.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to see that your vision for Imo State has resonated with the people and that you have been given a renewed mandate to continue the good work that you have already begun. Your commitment to transforming Imo State into a modern, vibrant, and prosperous state is a shining example to other leaders across the country.”</p>



<p>Kalu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Levinus Nwabughiogu, said Uzodinma’s margin of win had eloquently demonstrated how the people of Imo State re-established their unwavering confidence in his administration, the renewed hope agenda of President Bola Tinubu, and All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>



<p>He stated, “On behalf of my family, the good people of Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State, I congratulate you, my big brother, the indefatigable governor of Imo State, His Excellency, Senator Hope Uzodimma, on your big win at the polls.</p>



<p>“Your margin of win has eloquently stamped one fact: that the people of Imo State have re-established their unwavering confidence in your administration, the renewed hope agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>



<p>“The resounding victory is also a testament of your tireless efforts to reposition Imo State. For sure, the milestones you recorded in the last three and a half years of your administration endeared the people to you and made them opt for continuity.”</p>

<p><strong>Kogi Decides: APC Warns Mischief makers, Urges INEC to Uphold People&#8217;s Will&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The National Secretariat of the APC has warned against any attempt to truncate the will of the people in Kogi State while urging the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to remain steadfast in the commitment to its mandate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The party, in a statement, signed by Felix Morka, its National Publicity Secretary, said it was clear that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Usman Ododo, was coasting to spectacular victory in the Kogi gubernatorial election. It therefore called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to protect the integrity of the legitimate votes of the Kogi electorate.</p>



<p>The statement reads: &#8220;Announced and uploaded results, so far, show our Candidate maintaining a landslide lead in Kogi West and Central, with a competitive showing in Kogi East.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are keenly aware of intense pressure, including violent threats on INEC staff, by agents and supporters of trailing opposition parties aimed at unduly influencing or disrupting ongoing collation of results in the state.</p>



<p>&#8220;We urge INEC to be firm in the discharge of its constitutional duty to deliver free, fair and credible election in the state, and ensure that the freely exercised will of the Kogi electorate prevails&#8221;.</p>

<p>Our Correspondents</p>



<p>The governorship elections held in Bayelsa, Imo, and Kogi states yesterday were characterised by violence, voter apathy, and buying of votes.<br>This is coming as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has adjourned the collation of results for the Bayelsa State governorship election.<br>INEC also suspended elections in nine wards of Ogori/Magongo Local Government Area (LGA) of Kogi State, just as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Senator Dino Melaye, has called for the cancellation of the polls in five LGAs in the state.</p>



<p><br>Despite the violence, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State, Governor Hope Uzodimma and the Bayelsa State Governor and the candidate of the PDP, Senator Duoye Diri were leading, according to the results of the few polling units collated as at last night.<br>APC’s Usman Ododo was also leading from the results collated from few polling units in Kogi State.<br>In Bayelsa State, Senator Duoye Diri, has accused the candidate of the APC, Mr. Timipre Sylva, of being behind electoral violence recorded in the Nembe-Bassambiri area of the state, the APC candidate accused the PDP and security agents of harassing his supporters.</p>



<p><br>Elder statesman, Chief Edwin Clark has urged INEC to investigate reported cases of irregularities in the three states.<br>Former President Goodluck Jonathan, however, asked the National Assembly to work towards stopping off-season elections in the country.<br>Apart from violence, the governorship polls held across the three states were also characterised by logistics challenges.<br>Speaking to journalists yesterday in Abuja, the Chairman of the Centre for Democracy and Development Election Analysis Centre (CDD-EAC), Prof. Adele Jinadu, said the CDD deployed over 150 fact-checkers and observers in all three states, as well as a team of data clerks, reviewers, and analysts in its Situation Room in Abuja.</p>



<p><br>According to him, the observers reported that voting in 65 per cent of polling units observed in Bayelsa State and 80 per cent of polling units observed in Imo State started late, after the 8 am commencement time.<br>He said in the case of Kogi State, voting in 40 per cent of the polling units commenced late.<br>In many polling units in Imo State, the few voters, who were present confirmed that many eligible voters were scared of coming out to vote, due to fear of violence.</p>



<p><br>Several observers in Bayelsa State also reported the late arrival of INEC staff and security personnel.<br>In Yenagoa LGA, observers reported that one person was shot in the Famgbe community while voting ended abruptly in PU 24 Ward when thugs destroyed election materials.<br>The Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in the state, Mr. Udengs Eradiri, alleged that the election was marred by massive vote-buying.<br>“The level of vote-buying is overwhelming,” Eradiri said while commenting on the general conduct of the election.<br>Eradiri, who spoke at Agudama-Ekpetiama, Yenagoa LGA, said he was particularly disappointed about the open cases of vote-buying because his campaign was partly devoted to educating the people not to sell their votes.</p>



<p><br>“My greatest disappointment was with a woman from this community whom I offered a scholarship to her son, but today sold her vote for N14,000,” he added.<br>According to him, votes were freely traded for between N12,000 and N40,000 per person.<br>In Nembe LGA of Bayelsa State, election materials were allegedly secretly hijacked to a different location where agents were reportedly thumb-printing for one of the major political politics.</p>



<p><br>Before the governorship election, an INEC official was abducted on Friday while waiting to board a boat at the Amassoma Jetty, and later released. A boat also capsized on the eve of the exercise with electoral materials lost, according to INEC.<br>In Sagbama, Yenegoa, and Southern Ijaw LGAs, there were reports that votes were sold for between N5,000 and N22,000.<br>Reacting to the poll, Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Diri, accused the candidate of the APC, Sylva of being behind the electoral violence recorded in the Nembe-Bassambiri area of the state.<br>Diri, who spoke after he cast his vote in the poll, alleged that “Timipre Sylva has been violent in every election”.<br>“We have been raising the issue of the violent character and person of Timipre Sylva. Over the years, in every election he is involved in, you experience violence, you experience lawlessness, and even in Nembe-Bassambiri, the name and the character behind what is happening in Nembe-Bassambiri is Timipre Sylva,” Diri said.</p>



<p><br>Diri, however, commended the INEC for a “seamless” and “very fast” election, saying “This is an improvement on all the other elections.”<br>The PDP candidate, however, expressed concerns over the situation in Nembe-Bassambiri where he said some of his party members were disenfranchised.<br>Diri called for “a free, fair process where the BVAS should be used just as I have done here today. Let the accreditation be by the BVAS in Nembe-Bassambiri.<br>“Special attention has to be taken in Nembe-Bassambiri because everything points to the fact that in Nembe PDP members are chased out of their community.”<br>On his part, Sylva accused the PDP and security agents of harassing his supporters.<br>Sylva spoke after he cast his vote at Ward 4, Unit 4 in the Brass LGA of the state.</p>



<p><br>The APC candidate fingered security agents “especially the Army”, alleging that they are “playing on the side of the PDP”.<br>He said violence was recorded in Yenagoa, the state capital, alleging that an APC member was shot.<br>Meanwhile, INEC has adjourned the collation of results for the Bayelsa State governorship election.<br>The Returning Officer for the election, Mr. Faruk Adamu Kuta, who announced this last night at the INEC Collation Centre in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, said the collation would now take place by 10:00 am today.<br>Briefing journalists in Abuja, the Convener, Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yunusa Ya’u, said reports indicate that the BVAS functioned optimally in Bayelsa and Kogi states, with a low performance in Imo.<br>“The Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) functioned optimally in most polling units across the three states. However, there were reports of malfunctioning of the machines,” he said.</p>



<p><strong>Violence, Vote-buying, Apathy Mar Imo Election</strong></p>



<p>Tension was high yesterday in Imo State as violence and vote-buying allegations nearly marred the governorship election in the state with some of the voters selling their votes for as low as N2,000.<br>Reacting to the election, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Imo State, Athan Achonu, asked the INEC to cancel the votes in polling units marred by violence.</p>



<p><br>Achonu made the call after casting his vote in Umunumo hamlet in the Ehime Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State.<br>He alleged that some thugs beat up some agents of his party.<br>Describing the situation as crazy, he said the violence was contrary to democratic norms.<br>“They beat up so many of our agents. We are sad, we are going to upload some of their pictures. This is crazy, this is what our democracy has come to.”<br>Election observers also reported that INEC officials arrived late at many polling units in the state.</p>



<p><br>In his reaction, the governorship candidate of the PDP in the state, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, also raised the alarm over electoral malpractices in yesterday’s poll.<br>Speaking on the reports from the party agents in the field, Anyanwu alleged incidents of vote-buying, ballot box snatching, and other irregularities in some polling units.</p>



<p><br>He spoke in an interview with journalists in his Amaimo residence in Ikeduru LGA.<br>The PDP candidate accused party agents of the ruling APC of “coercing voters to vote for the party”.<br>He further alleged that some PDP agents were shot by political thugs.<br>According to him, one of the PDP vehicles was burnt at Inyishi Community in the LGA, while the agents were trying to resist the thugs.<br>He, therefore, called for the cancellation of the results of the poll in the areas allegedly rocked by thuggery and violence.<br>He also urged INEC “to beam its searchlight on Ikeduru LGA”.</p>



<p><br>He said: “I have evidence that one of the thugs is a member of the House of Assembly.<br>“In the process of snatching the ballot boxes, the lawmaker’s Identity Card fell off and I have it here with me.<br>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that there were cases of vote buying and coercion of voters in Owerri North LGA.<br>It was also learnt that some thugs invaded the Umuokoro Village Hall, Iho, also in the LGA, where they allegedly snatched and destroyed ballot boxes and ballot papers.<br>&nbsp;INEC Suspends Election in Nine Kogi Wards as Melaye SeeKs Cancellation of Poll in Five LGAs<br>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Kogi State PDP governorship candidate, Senator Dino Melaye, yesterday called for the cancellation of the election in five LGAs of the state.<br>The LGAs, according to Melaye, are Okene, Okehi, Ajaokuta, Adavi, and Ogori/Mangogo.</p>



<p><br>He alleged that the election in the five LGAs “is a scam coordinated from the highest level of INEC.”<br>Melaye did not show up at his polling unit situated at Iluafon quarters, Aiyetoro 1, Ijumu LGA of the state.<br>INEC has, however, suspended elections in nine wards of Ogori/Magongo LGA of Kogi State.<br>The Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, INEC, Kogi, Muhammad Kudu Haruna, made this known in a statement.<br>The statement said the commission had received reports on incidences of electoral malpractices, particularly the incident of result sheets completed before voting.</p>



<p><br>“Reports indicate that the incidents occurred in Adavi, Ajaokuta, Ogori/Magongo, Okehi, and Okene Local Government Areas. The most serious incidents occurred in Ogori/Magongo, affecting nine of 10 Registration Areas. This is entirely unacceptable. Any result not emanating from the Commission’s process in the Polling Units will not be accepted.<br>“The commission is determined not to reward bad behaviour. Consequently, the election in the nine Wards in Ogori/Magongo LGA (Eni, Okibo, Okesi, Ileteju, Aiyeromi, Ugugu, Obinoyin, Obatgben and Oturu) is at this moment suspended. The incidences in the other local government areas are being thoroughly investigated, and the outcome, including the way forward, will be announced in the next 24 hours,” the statement added.<br>There were reports of vote-buying in the state.</p>



<p><br>Of particular concern were the reports of irregularities in Ogori/Magongo LGA where there were pre-filled election result sheets in areas where voting had not even commenced.<br>There were also reports of the Igalamela LGA chairman being caught by security personnel with bullets and wads of naira notes.<br>Electoral violence was reported in Dekini LGA, specifically in Anyigba town, where a thug was reportedly shot and killed by soldiers while fleeing in an attempt to snatch a ballot box. There was a similar attempt in Ajaokuta LGA where an LGA chairman was apprehended by voters.</p>



<p><strong>Clark Urges INEC to Investigate Alleged Irregularities</strong></p>



<p>Following the violence that marred the polls, elder statesman, Chief Clark, has urged INEC to investigate reported cases of irregularities in the Bayelsa, Imo, and Kogi governorship elections.<br>Clark made the call when a group, South-south Diamond Ladies paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.<br>He said the discovery of completed result sheets with names of voters even before the first vote was cast was very unfortunate.<br>Clark, who is also the Leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) said for INEC to redeem its image from the fallout of the 2023 general election, the commission must investigate alleged irregularities reported in the three states.</p>



<p><br>He said: “This is an election to allow the INEC to redeem itself. Discovering completed result sheets with names of voters and so on is very unfortunate.<br>“INEC should investigate and make a public statement on this issue otherwise, they will be condemned as we did in the last general election. I still believe the election will be free and fair to a greater extent.<br>“The elections in Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi. I think INEC should redeem its image.<br>“What happened in the last election was very disappointing because if you say that you are going to use technology, you must use it because you provide it in your guidelines and the electoral law.<br>“INEC should redeem its image because, without an effective, honest INEC, we are in trouble because democracy will not work in this country.”</p>



<p><strong>Stop Off-season Elections, Jonathan Tells National Assembly</strong></p>



<p>In another development, former President Goodluck Jonathan has asked the National Assembly to work towards stopping off-season elections.</p>



<p>Jonathan said this yesterday after casting his ballot at Polling Unit 39, Ward 13, Otuoke, Ogbia LGA of Bayelsa State.</p>



<p>Jonathan said off-cycle polls should be struck out and harmonised with the general election.</p>



<p>According to him, with the way things are going in Nigeria, the presidential election may become off-season.</p>



<p>He said an off-season presidential poll “almost happened in 2007 when I contested as a running mate with President Umaru Musa Yar’adua” but it was prevented.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I get worried about the issue of off-season election and I will use this as a unique opportunity to plead with the National Assembly that we need to block this off-season election; it is very odd, it’s not a global best practice.”</p>



<p>“A country can elect their people at different times like America, they may not elect at the same time, but every time they go on to do elections, they elect everybody that is meant to be elected. If we continue with this trend of off-season elections based on the interpretation of our laws, it will come to a time that the presidential election will be off-season; probably that’s the time that a lot of you &#8211; media people should be worried.</p>



<p>“Look at the American system everybody knows when the American elections will be conducted, that’s the standard practice of other countries.”</p>



<p><strong>EFCC Arrests Suspected Vote Buyers, Recovers N11m</strong></p>



<p>Also, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said yesterday that its operatives arrested 14 suspected vote buyers in Otueke, Adawari playgrounds in Bayelsa State, and at various polling units in Imo and Kogi states.</p>



<p>A statement by the commission last night said the suspects were arrested on November 11, 2023, during intelligence-driven operations that commenced several days before the ongoing governorship elections in the three states.</p>



<p>It said a total sum of N11,040,000 was recovered, including N9,310,000 intercepted by operatives and recovered from suspected vote buyers and sellers in Bayelsa, while N1,730,000 was recovered from electoral fraud suspects in Imo State.</p>



<p>The statement signed by the Spokesman of the EFCC Dele Oyewale, said two vehicles were intercepted by the operatives of the commission.</p>

<p><strong>Vote-buying Overwhelming in&nbsp;Bayelsa Poll, LP Candidate&nbsp; Alleges</strong></p>



<p>Mr Udengs Eradiri, the Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Bayelsa, says the gubernatorial election held on Saturday in the state has been marred by massive vote-buying.</p>



<p>“The level of vote-buying is overwhelming,” Eradiri said while commenting on the general conduct of the election.</p>



<p>Eradiri who spoke at Agudama-Ekpetiama, Yenagoa Local Government Area, claimed that he was even approached to step down, but declined.</p>



<p>He said he was particularly disappointed about the open cases of vote-buying, because his campaign was partly devoted to educating the people not to sell their votes.</p>



<p>“I had thought my messages against money politics would have been tracking with the people, but I was wrong. I am deeply disappointed, I was wrong.</p>



<p>“My greatest dispoinyment was with a woman from this community whom I offered scholarship to her son, but today sold her vote for N14,000,” he added.</p>



<p>The LP governorship candidate regretted that the electorates seemed to have opted for money instead of voting for the right candidate.</p>



<p>“We have a long way to go in stopping money politics in this country.</p>



<p>“I thought I had found a solution but I was wrong. I did not come into this race to buy votes,” Eradiri added.</p>



<p>According to him, votes were freely traded for between N12,000 and N40,000 per vote. (NAN)</p>

<p><strong>Uzodimma, Anyanwu Differ on&nbsp;Guber Poll, Amidst Low Voter Turnout&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Governor Hope Uzodimma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, on Saturday expressed diverse views on the conduct of the Saturday governorship election in Imo.</p>



<p>Both candidates spoke shortly after casting their votes at their various polling units amidst low voter turnout.</p>



<p>Uzodimma, who voted at 11:35a.m. at Polling Unit 032, Ekwenja Ukwu-Ozu ward, Omuma community, Oru East Local Government Area of the state, said reports he received showed that the election was peaceful in most parts of the state.</p>



<p>“The election, contrary to what they said on the social media, is going on free, fair and very peaceful.</p>



<p>“You can see how freely I have gone out to cast my votes and also how INEC was able to process my accreditation under a few minutes.</p>



<p>“It is evident for all of us in the country to know that the patriotic people of the state are desirous of having Imo State blossom,” he said.</p>



<p>However, the governor urged those in the opposition allegedly sponsoring mischief and other forms of criminality to repent.</p>



<p>”Some of us are in politics to serve the people and are in politics for the interest of the people.</p>



<p>“We say things as they are really on ground.</p>



<p>“Some are out to confuse the populace. They just go to the social media and fabricate stories and publish.</p>



<p>“But when you visit the polling units, you will now see that there is peace there,” he said.</p>



<p>Uzodimma commended INEC and security agencies for ensuring proper deployment of material and personnel for the election.</p>



<p>“The entire space is manned and occupied and people are responding positively.</p>



<p>“I have not heard any knockout, so I think Imo State is safe and it is good to go.</p>



<p>“I have just voted and some people are still voting.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, whatever God approved will be announced by INEC,” he said.</p>



<p>On his part, the candidate of the PDP, Senator Anyanwu, expressed worries over reports of alleged ballot box snatching in some areas of the state.</p>



<p>”Though they started very late, which was the problem we had here where others started by 8:00am, I just cast my vote at about 10:25am.</p>



<p>”This is my home town and my people are excited to cast their votes because one of their own is coming out for election,” he said.</p>



<p>He alleged that materials and votes were carted away at about seven wards in Orlu.</p>



<p>He said similar incidents were reported at Orsu and parts of Oru West, wondering why opposition parties would not allow free and fair election in the state.</p>



<p>“We should not encourage hooliganism. When you bring people like that to help you win.</p>



<p>“That is not the type of society we want and a responsible government should not encourage such.</p>



<p>“Imo people are desirous of change but some people are trying to truncate it. It will never work,” he stated. (NAN)</p>

<p><strong>Party Agents, Voters, Observers Laud Peaceful Poll, BVAS</strong></p>



<p>Some party agents, voters and observers have commended the peaceful voting process and seamless&nbsp;Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) deployed for Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa State.</p>



<p>They gave the commendation in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yenagoa.</p>



<p>The respondents agreed that the election was largely smooth and peaceful across Yenagoa Local Government Area.</p>

<p>Mr Ambrose Kwokor, a civil servant, who voted at the PU, also said that the election was going on peacefully.</p>



<p>“The election has been going on smoothly. There was no cause for alarm in the election so far. The BVAS is also working well,” Kwokor said.</p>



<p>He called on the people to remain peaceful during and after the election.</p>



<p>At PU 011, Yenada Market Square, Epie III Ward, Yenagoa with 822 registered voters, the polling process was observed to be peaceful and orderly.</p>



<p>Mrs Sarah Godfrey, a 60-year-old civil servant, after casting her vote, commended INEC for making special arrangements for elderly persons to vote without hassle.</p>



<p>Godfrey, who recently had a surgery, said that she came out to vote for the future of her children.</p>



<p>“I had surgical operation, but I could not sit down at home without voting. I am doing this because I believe it will be the turn of my children tomorrow,” Godfrey said.</p>



<p>However, an 86-year-old woman, Mrs Mercy Okodo, who came to the polling unit could not find her name.</p>



<p>Okodo expressed disappointment that her name was missing in spite of voting at the same polling unit in the past.</p>



<p>“I’m surprised to be told that my name is not on the voters list, it’s very disappointing,” the octogenarian said.</p>



<p>At PU 10 at Fanghe Primary School, Epie III Ward, Yenagoa LGA, which has 750 registered voters,&nbsp;Mr Andrew Asaba, a businessman, expressed pleasure with the orderly conduct of voters.</p>

<p><strong>Votes Sold for N20,000 in Bayelsa, Says CSO</strong></p>



<p>Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja&nbsp;</p>



<p>An election observer group, Connected Development (CODE), has expressed dismay over verified reports of vote buying, saying votes were sold for as high as N20,000 in Market Square, Ogia Town Ward of Ogbia Local government area of Bayelsa state.</p>



<p>It added that votes buying were also witnessed at Ama-Ukwu Umuawaka Square Ward, of Njaba LGA, Imo state where votes were traded for as low as one N1,000, describing the practice as disturbing and must be halted.</p>



<p>Its Director, Democracy and Governance and head of Uzabe Elections Situation Room, Emmanuel Njoku, disclosed this while addressing a midday press conference in Lokoja, Kogi state.</p>



<p>He noted that it was heartening to report that the overall atmosphere in all three states had been peaceful and calm.</p>



<p>Njoku commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Permit for the early deployment of Adhoc staff and materials which ensured the early commencement of voting in various wards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added priority voting for the elderly had been observed in various locations like Mopa-Muro LGA in Kogi (Pandaya Market) and Ekeremor LGA (Ayama Ward) in Bayelsa amongst others.</p>



<p>Njoku added: &#8220;Disturbingly, in Bayelsa, Market Square Ogia Town Ward of Ogbia LGA, verified reports of vote buying have surfaced, with amounts going as high as N20,000. This was also observed at Ama-Ukwu Umuawaka Square Ward, of Njaba LGA, Imo state where votes were traded for as low as one thousand naira. This practice is disturbing and must be halted.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we anticipate further developments as voting is gradually coming to an end in many polling units across these states, sorting, counting, collation of results, we earnestly call upon all stakeholders to maintain their commitment to a peaceful electoral process.&#8221;</p>



<p>Njoku stressed that Bayelsa witnessed delayed voting in Kanabiri comp Ward of Sagbama LGA due to the absence of party agents, and late arrival of INEC officials at Yenogoa-Fankpo Square Ward.</p>



<p>He noted: &#8220;An incident in Ekeremor LGA (Azidekeoreyeine Square Ward), involved an individual attempting to abscond with INEC materials, but citizens resolved the situation without injuries. This stands as a testament to the collective power of the masses.</p>



<p>&#8220;At Eke-mbutu Market Square Ward of Mbaitoli LGA, Imo state, the BVAS machine malfunctioned and displayed Chinese language, causing a delay that was much later rectified.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we cannot conclusively speak to voter turnout at this time, low voter turnout has been reported in some parts of these states. like we observed at Owerri North at Okwu Uratta Primary School Ward.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>APC Supporter Killed in Kogi</strong></p>



<p>Suspected political thugs have gunned down a 35-year-old APC&nbsp; supporter, Umar Hassan, at his Agala Ogane Polling Unit, Anyigba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fear gripped voters at the Polling Unit as thugs were on rampage, threatening to kill anyone who votes against the &#8220;Igala Agenda&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An eye witness who identified himself simply as Adamu, told newsmen how susoected SDP thugs invaded the Polling Unit with sophisticated weapons, threatening to kill anyone who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t vote for the SDP&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was like what we watch in horror movies as they invaded our Polling Unit with very dangerous weapons. Unfortunately, Hassan fell victim and he was gunned down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;They kept chanting war songs that they will kill anyone who voted against the Igala Agenda. They targeted Hassan being an APC member.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What surprised me most was that the Military guys that had been targeting APC supporters for arrest and harassment were not on ground to save Hassan&#8217;s life. It was so unfortunate&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was gathered that there was calm across many Polling Units in Anyigba until the gunmen stormed many units to fight anyone suspected to be an APC member.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reports showed that the poll had been peaceful so far in the Central and Western Senatorial Districts.</p>



<p>When contacted, the Spokesperson of the APC Governorship Campaign Council, Hon. Kingsley Fanwo condemned the attack and urged security agencies to fish out the killers immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The gruesome murder of Hassan Umar whose only sin was being an APC member is unacceptable. The security agents in the area should fish out the murderers immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the 21st century, it is sad that people are still killed for supporting a particular political party. It is unacceptable and condemnable. We knew the only agenda of the SDP is to wage violence against our people. We must restore confidence in our electoral process&#8221;, he said.</p>



<p>SDP could not be reached for response.</p>

<p><strong>LP Faction Accuses Ajaero of Using NLC to Prosecute Personal Agenda in Imo&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A faction of the Labour Party (LP) led by Lamidi Apapa has accused the Nigeria Labour Congress (NPC) President, Joe Ajaero, of using the NLC to prosecute a personal agenda of both political and economic against the Imo State government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The party also accused the NLC of hiding under the assault on its president to sabotage President Bola Tinubu&#8217;s government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Publicity Secretary of the LP faction, Abayomi Arabambi, said this in a statement on Saturday in Abuja.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The party also carpeted organised labour for blocking the roads leading to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport as part of protest against the brutalisation of Ajaero by alleged thugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NLC president led a protest to Owerri, the Imo State capital, against the state government where he was assaulted.</p>



<p>This has led the NLC and Trade Union Congress (TUC) threatening to embark on a nationwide strike on November 14 unless its demands are met.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement by the LP faction said: &#8220;Joe Ajaero&#8217;s indiscriminate use of NLC to prosecute his personal agenda of attempted political and economic conquest of his home state of Imo is an affirmation of his desire to overthrow democracy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just yesterday, he was quoted to have said that nothing is wrong if INEC postpones the scheduled Saturday election and further affirmed their decision to go ahead with the strike by midnight of Monday despite the restraining order granted to the Federal Government of Nigeria by the National Industrial Court.</p>



<p>&#8220;What manner of institutionalised manifest executive rascality on display, the first of its kind by a labour union leader with a posture that he is a government on his own. Joe Ajaero&#8217;s disregard for rule of law is very alarming and such an action has definitely overstretched the limit of law permissible thus constituting a treasonable felony act.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here was a man whose instincts tell him that the people of Nigeria must be made to suffer because his ego was bruised by Imo State workers who are protesting his dictatorial tendencies of attempting to install his cousin as the chairman of Imo State Council of NLC.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Minister of Aviation and AeroSpace Development would recollect that some weeks ago, the Federal Executive Council, chaired by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu approved and adopted wholesale the MoU and some of the agreements in the MoU have&nbsp; being implemented. The wage award of N35,000 to federal workers is being paid. The N25,000 to be paid over 6 months to 15 million households is also being executed.</p>



<p>&#8220;President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration has also demonstrated his&nbsp; commitments to the MoU by the removal of the 7.5% VAT on diesel as demanded by the labour movement and last week launched the Compressed Natural Gas vehicles, which it promised to provide countrywide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;But despite all this laudable commitment, the Joe Ajaero led military wing supporters of Labour Party are hell bent on going on with the strike and shutting down the economy with the sole aim of political and economic conquest of Nigeria simply because one container loads economist bland petition was dismissed under two mins by the Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>



<p>The party urged the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development not to blame it for the actions of some persons.</p>



<p>&#8220;We advise the Hon minister to wake up some of&nbsp; the lame duck APC leaderships who out of fear for those toothless Obidient have abandoned the APC ruling party responsibilities to voice their opinions against Joe Ajaero and his military wing of Peter Obi Labour Party support group attempted insurrection through violent overthrow of the administration of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.</p>



<p>&#8220;The president&#8217;s many appointees are also culpable in the current shenanigans been orchestrated by Joe Ajaero military junta because they have suddenly become voiceless, unconcerned about the legitimacy and safety of the President of Nigeria Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu which has since been confirmed by the Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Bello, Ododo Applaud INEC, Security Personnel&#8217;s Conduct at Off-cycle Guber Poll</strong></p>



<p>Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security operatives for their conduct at Saturday’s off-cycle governorship election in the state.</p>



<p>The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election, Alhaji Usman Ododo, gave similar commendation.</p>



<p>Bello spoke after voting at his polling unit in Okene, where he noted that the level of preparedness by INEC and its officials resulted in a smooth conduct of the exercise.</p>



<p>“I commend INEC for a job well done. I also commend security operatives for offering residents of Kogi the peaceful environment to participate in the election without hindrance.</p>



<p>“I am optimistic that our candidate, Usman Ododo, will emerge victorious at the end of the exercise.</p>



<p>“We have come out in numbers to cast our votes. I have just cast my vote and others are casting their votes. It is timely. All materials were deployed within the time stipulated.</p>



<p>“So far, I haven’t heard of complaint from any quarter. The conduct of INEC so far has been so fantastic. All the security agencies have conducted themselves so far very professionally.</p>



<p>“Citizens that are exercising their franchise are doing that freely. There are no hitches; no rancour.</p>



<p>“We are united and we are happy at this exercise. By the special grace of God we are going to come off very triumphant,’’ Bello said.</p>



<p>The governor also did some comparisons between elections held in Kogi over the years and the ones conducted since he got into office in 2015.</p>



<p>“From the benefit of hindsight and looking back at 2019, this brings a strong reminder of an election.</p>



<p>“Incidence of electoral violence in Kogi in my own time is a media creation. Go into history; go into records and compare my own regime and that of the previous ones.</p>



<p>“You will discover that in the regime of Governor Bello, conduct of elections has been violence-free exercises; the freest; the most free, fair and credible.</p>



<p>“Therefore, the issue of violence in our election in Kogi is a media creation and figment of imagination of all those who do not want good things to happen here in Kogi.</p>



<p>“There is nothing like violence. The conduct of free and fair and credible election is in the hands of security agencies and the citizens,’’ he said.</p>



<p>On his part, Ododo also expressed satisfaction at the conduct of security operatives at the election and praised them for ensuring that things were smooth and peaceful.</p>



<p>“While I express confidence at winning this election, I thank Kogi people for turning out en mass to vote in the crucial exercise,’’ he said. (NAN)</p>

<p><strong>Security Operatives Foil Attempt to Abduct INEC Officials, Materials&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><br>Vigilant security operatives in Imo State Saturday, foiled an attempt by suspected political thugs to abduct Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and cart away election materials.</p>



<p>The incident happened at a registration area centre in Amaimo, Ikeduru Local Government Area of the state.</p>



<p>It was learnt that the attempt by the thugs to whisk away the INEC officials into their waiting vehicle was quickly repelled by the security personnel deployed in the centre.</p>



<p>An eyewitness said that the armed security operatives fired into the air from a distance, when voters in the area raised an alarm over the presence of the thugs.</p>



<p>“The thugs quickly retreated into their bus and sped off on hearing the sound of the gun,” the eyewitness told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the condition of anonymity.</p>



<p>An unarmed Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) operative at the scene said: “The thugs were coming to hijack the INEC officials and election materials.</p>



<p>“But luck ran out on them when some people started shouting during a stampede caused by fear.</p>



<p>“It was their shouting that alerted the armed security personnel, who quickly shot into the air, forcing the thugs to take to their heels,” the NSCDC operative said on the condition of anonymity.</p>



<p>There was heavy presence of security personnel on major roads in the state.</p>



<p>In Owerri, the state capital, and its environs, armed security personnel mounted checkpoints at strategic locations as early as 6:00a.m. to enforce restriction on movements.</p>



<p>Heavily armed soldiers were seen at different entry points into the city, stopping and searching vehicles, as well as interrogating the drivers and passengers before allowing them to go.</p>



<p>All the polling units in Isu Njaba had materials and INEC officials were on ground as early as 8.00am.</p>



<p>Consequently, the accreditation of voters commenced at about 8.30am in the area without any security presence at the time of filing the report. (NAN)</p>



<p><strong>11:27am</strong></p>



<p><strong>Voter Apathy, Absence of Election Materials Threaten Poll</strong></p>



<p>Saturday’s governorship election in Imo State took off in some parts of the state on a shaky note with low voter turnout and absence of election officials and materials at some polling units (PUs) visited.</p>



<p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that in some PUs, some voters were seen, along with security personnel, waiting for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and materials as at 8:30am.</p>



<p>At PU 001 Ekeama Primary School, Awaka I, near Owerri, some voters and security personnel were present, while electoral officials and materials were being awaited.</p>



<p>A voter, Mrs Hilda Nnadi, said that she was confident that the materials would soon be brought to the unit.</p>



<p>“I believe materials will soon arrive and we’ll vote. I’ll be patient,” Nnadi said.</p>



<p>The same situation also prevailed at PU 002 Ekeama Primary School, Awaka II, and PU 003 Community Primary School, Amapu Awaka.</p>



<p>A voter, Mr Fidelis Nwokedi, also expressed confidence in the process.</p>



<p>“It’s an off cycle election and I believe that INEC has all it takes to make it successful.</p>



<p>“I’m hopeful that they will soon be here,“ he said.</p>



<p>The situation at PU 004 Community Primary School, Amapu Awaka II, and PU 016 Emeohe Village Hall, was largely different with low voter turnout, absence of security personnel, INEC officials and materials.</p>



<p>A visibly disappointed voter, Miss Amaka Okpara, said: “Only very few of us are here and there is no security, not even one police officer.</p>



<p>“I will soon leave, go back to my house, if they don’t come.”</p>



<p>A similar situation was recorded at PU 007 Community Primary School, Ihita-Ogada II, PU 008 Ihita-Ogada Village Square and PU 011 Health Centre, Ubah Emii I, where some voters and security personnel were seen waiting for INEC officials and materials.</p>



<p>The same situation was also observed at PU 013 Eziala Village Square, where the voters, who came out in their numbers, were also seen with security personnel waiting for INEC Officials and materials.</p>



<p>At PU 012, Central School, Amaimo, in Ikeduru LGA, which is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Samuel Anyanwu’s Polling Unit, INEC officials and materials had yet to arrive as at 8:45a.m.</p>



<p>There was also no security personnel at the PU but voters were seen around waiting to exercise their franchise.</p>



<p>A voter, Mr Ibe Chika, said he arrived at the polling unit as early as 8:00a.m. but was disappointed that no INEC official had arrived (NAN)</p>

<p>Also, at Open space by Ava hotel&nbsp; polling unit, election commenced at about 9:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Presiding officer had to delay the commencement of voting because they were waiting for other party agents.</p>



<p>At FMC junction polling unit 058, a voter, Mrs Grace Iyere said the election was peaceful and voting was going well.</p>



<p>According to her, &#8220;The BVAS is working. Some are saying they need changes, it is only when you come out and vote that you can see the changes.</p>



<p>The election is peaceful. I trekked from my house to this place and the road was free.&#8221;</p>



<p>At Ajagbe/Moremi&nbsp; polling unit 008 Ajagbe in Lokoja, a Christian Association of Nigeria Observer, Mr. Ojo Stephen commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>



<p>He said electoral officers&nbsp; arrived at 8:03 a.m, while voting materials were displayed at 8:40 to the electorate.</p>

<p><strong>PDP Accuses APC of Vote Buying in Yenagoa</strong></p>



<p>Segun James in Yenagoa</p>



<p>Barely one hour after the commencement of voting in the governorship election in Bayelsa State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of vote buying in the poll.</p>



<p>The PDP, in a statement signed by the state&#8217;s Publicity Secretary, Ebiye Agu Ogoli, called the attention of &#8220;the general public to an electoral fraud being perpetrated by the All Progressives Congress (APC) where they have been caught deviously buying PVCs of gullible voters with the sum of N50,000 with intent to rig Saturday&#8217;s governorship election; and this is happening in Yenagoa metropolis particularly in Onopa, Amarata and its environs. We are shocked by the desperation of the APC and condemn it in its entirety. We take exception to this absurdity and call on the security agents to arrest the culprits and bring them to book&#8221;.</p>



<p>The party instructed the party agents &#8220;that they collect the list of BVAS machines sent to the Registration Area; confirm the total number sent; taking note of the serial number of the BVAS machines and cross-check same against the serial number on the master sheet from the RAC centre.</p>



<p>&#8220;That on day of election, voters should check to confirm that the BVAS machines read 0 before accreditation commences.</p>



<p>&#8220;That BVAS machines be purged to confirm total number of voters accredited before they begin actual counting of ballot papers sent to the polling unit;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ensure that no voter approach the ballot box to cast his/her vote with more than one ballot paper; ensure APO&#8217;s do not issue more than one ballot paper to any voter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ensure that Presiding Officers display result sheet to the general public before entering the scores of each political party;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That PDP calls on INEC, the National Commissioner i/c South-south, Supervising REC&#8217;s, Electoral officers, SPO&#8217;s etc to maintain neutrality, act in a fair and transparent manner with all political parties contesting the governorship election&#8221;.</p>

<p><br>The IG also announced that dignitaries and Very Important Persons would not be allowed to move around with police escorts on election day, adding that it violates the Electoral Law.<br>“And anyone that does that is violating the electoral law and is liable to prompt arrest, and such people will get dealt with when they’re arrested,” the police chief stated.<br>Also yesterday, the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, assured residents of Kogi, Bayelsa, and Imo states of their security during the governorship elections.<br>This is as he warned political actors against any act of violence in the states.<br>Ribadu stressed that there would be “severe consequences” for anyone found trying to disrupt the elections in the three states.<br>Ribadu noted a monitoring system had been established with monitors deployed to the field to collect any evidence of violence and irregularities.</p>



<p><strong>Kogi State</strong><br>Today’s gubernatorial election is a three-horse race in Kogi State. The leading contestants are Usman Ododo of the APC, Dino Melaye of the PDP and Murtala Ajaka of the SDP. Analysts argue that the three candidates are from different ethnic backgrounds, namely Ebira, Okun and Igala, respectively and that the voting pattern may likely reflect the same. While APC will dictate the pace in Kogi central, the SDP will make a huge statement in Kogi East and PDP will dominate Kogi West.</p>



<p><strong>Usman Ododo</strong><br>Ododo was, in the last seven and half years, the Local Government Auditor General of Kogi State before his emergence as the flag bearer of the APC. He hails from Okene (Kogi Central) just as the outgoing governor.<br>Ododo, an Ebira, is expected to win the five local government areas in the zone.<br>He will have it tough in Kogi West, where agitation for power shift is intense. However, based on the dividends of democracy enjoyed in the area under Governor Bello, particularly with the establishment of a university in Kabba, Ododo is expected to get a fairly good number of votes here.<br>In Kogi East, the cries of marginalisation and agitations for power shift will deny Ododo significant votes. The influence of the incumbent Deputy Governor, Edward Onoja, and Ododo’s running mate, Joel Oyibo, both from the zone, may however help to attract some votes. The fact that Kogi East has 14 governorship candidates in today’s election may be a plus for Ododo.</p>



<p><strong>Murtala Ajaka</strong><br>As a result of his inability to secure the governorship ticket on the platform of the APC, Ajaka dumped the party and subsequently emerged as the candidate of SDP. Prior to this time, he was the National Deputy Publicity Secretary of APC. With his emergence, the political observers in Kogi State have argued that it may have altered political permutations, with many in his zone seeking a return to power tagged “Igala Agenda.”<br>The rising profile of Ajaka in Kogi East allegedly led to violent clashes between APC and SPD supporters in the state. Ajaka is expected to dominate Kogi East.<br>In Kogi West, the presence of SDP is felt in few local government areas but Ajaka will still make an impact. Ajaka’s chances in Kogi Central are very slim.</p>



<p><strong>Dino Melaye</strong><br>Dino Melaye’s emergence as PDP’s flag bearer not only split the party, but also resulted in a gale of defections. The big wigs from the Kogi West axis left the party over alleged doctoring of the delegates’ list at the primary. This notwithstanding, Melaye has put his acts together in his determination to wrest power from the APC.<br>Melaye hails from Aiyetoro Gbede in the Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State. Unfortunately, some leaders of the party in Kogi West are not happy with 2015 episode when Dino played the role of a spoiler, preventing an Okun son becoming the governor after the sudden death of Audu. However, Melaye may still dominate Kogi West. He will struggle to make an impact in Kogi Central and Kogi East.</p>



<p><strong>Imo State</strong><br>The key contestants in today’s election in Imo State are incumbent Governor Hope Uzodinma of the APC, Sam Anyanwu of the PDP and Athan Achonu of the Labour Party. The race is seen as unpredictable and could swing in favour of any of the three leading contenders.</p>



<p><strong>Hope Uzodinma</strong><br>Factors definitely not in Uzodinma’s favour include Imo State’s degeneration from centre of relaxation and hospitality to hotbed of insecurity and violence.<br>Ordinarily, the incumbency factor would have given Uzodinma an edge, but the state’s persisting insecurity could hinder his chances. Some say his actions and body language are contributory factors in the violence and uncertainty in the state.<br>Additionally, there is the populist sentiment that his best had not been good enough for the state.</p>



<p><br>What stands out in Uzodinma’s favour is the spread of the APC structures across the length and breadth of Imo State.<br>Further enhancing Uzodinma’s chances include the squabbles in the two main opposition parties – PDP and LP.<br>Two jokers Uzodinma may finally play include the ethnic card, and the Federal might. The former two-term Senator of Orlu zone, with its 12 LGAs, is the man to beat today.<br>The Federal might would equally come in handy for Uzodinma as the APC-led federal government would not be willing to lose Imo, its strongest South-east ally, either to the LP or the PDP.<br>APC, as a ruling party is an attractive bait to political elites, some seeking political rehabilitation and revival or as a haven to escape investigation or prosecution for corruption charges. Such big names which had clustered around Uzodinma would bargain for a piece of the pie and support him.</p>



<p><strong>Athan Achonu</strong><br>Achonu is expected to pool the majority of the votes from the Okigwe zone. The Peter Obi LP sentiments would equally enhance Achonu’s chances, especially in the metropolitan capital city of Owerri where collapsing infrastructure, particularly road network, had distanced the people from Uzodinma.<br>But the LP is weakened by internal bickering after its hotly contested governorship primary which led to the exodus from the party of several ‘Obedients’ who would have brought the Peter Obi wave to bear on the election.<br>Besides Ochudo Martin Agbaso, another LP chieftain, General Jack Ogunewe left the party to pick the Action Alliance ticket. Others like Dr Sam Amadi have refused to support Achonu, while some like Dr Fabian Ihekweme, a former Commissioner and one-time gubernatorial candidate had subtly defected to the Uzodinma camp.<br>A decisive Mindshift by the people and a high turnout of voters might favour the LP candidate, but there are fears that the insecurity scare would checkmate such development.</p>



<p><strong>Sam Anyanwu</strong><br>PDP’s internal bickering, including the Emeka Ihedioha factor, may work against Anyanwu’s chances today. It would seem the absence of Ihedioha in the race united his Mbaise people to solidly line up behind Uzodinma.<br>The PDP boasts of widespread structures, but the bickering and sabotage rocking the party had clearly diminished its potential and robbed Anyanwu of the enormous goodwill the party hitherto enjoyed.<br>Findings show that Ihedioha was able to triumph in 2019 by winning with the largest votes from the nine LGAs of Owerri zone and consolidating with votes from one or two LGs from Orlu and Okigwe zones. Would the same formula work for Anyanwu? Perhaps not.<br>While both Owerri and Okigwe zones are bitter that the Orlu zone has had more than its fair share of the governorship, occupying it for 20 out of 24 years of democracy, they do not have a winning formula that could effectively combine their joint 15 LGAs against Orlu’s 12, thus the Uzodimma joker, even as he seems to have votes from Orlu’s 12 LGAs safely under his belt.</p>



<p><strong>Bayelsa State</strong><br>The leading candidates in Bayelsa State are incumbent governor Douye Diri of the PDP, Timipre Sylva of the APC and Udengs Eradiri of the LP.</p>



<p><strong>Douye Diri</strong><br>Diri, a former teacher, Organising Secretary of the Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC), hails from Kolokuma/Okpokuma Local Government Area. He was a Senator, a former member of the House of Representatives, and former Commissioner for Youth and Sports in the state.<br>The incumbent governor is looking good for a second term based on his first term performance and the fact that leading opposition parties in the state are in crisis.<br>Diri is heading to the warfront with a more formidable and united party. The PDP has been ruling Bayelsa State since 1999.<br>During the last general election, PDP cruised to victory in most of the seats contested, winning all the National Assembly seats and majority of the state’s House of Assembly seats.</p>



<p><strong>Timipre Sylva</strong><br>Sylva, who hails from Okpoama, Brass Local Government Area, based on his antecedent and pedigree, is the strongest among those jostling to wrestle power from Diri.<br>However, his campaign was negatively affected by the failed attempts to disqualify him through the court.<br>He was a former governor of the state for four years and immediate past Minister of State for Petroleum Resources.<br>Some members have accused him of running the party as his private estate, they blame the abysmal performance of the party in the state at the 2023 elections on his overbearing attitude.<br>They accuse Sylva of imposing himself as the party gubernatorial candidate to the detriment of a more popular candidate in David Lyon.</p>



<p><strong>Udengs Eradiri</strong><br>Eradiri is the youngest among the leading candidates at just 47. He is an Engineering graduate from the University of Benin.<br>The former President, IYC worldwide was Commissioner for Youths and later Environment under the Seriake Dickson administration. Eradiri is regarded as the dark horse among those jostling to occupy the Creek Haven.<br>The youth activist turned politician is from Agudama-Ekpetiama, Yenagoa Local Government Area.</p>



<p><strong>Key Battle Areas in Bayelsa</strong><br>Going by feelers from the Bayelsa East, comprising Brass, Nembe and Ogbia local government areas, regarded as the APC stronghold and Sylva’s Senatorial District, the APC might cause the PDP some pains here.<br>Diri is expected to win big in the Bayelsa West Senatorial District which has Sagbama and Ekeremor local government areas. This is also home to PDP big wigs like former Governor Seriake Dickson; Fred Agbedi; the Deputy Governor, Lawrence Ewrujakpor.<br>In Bayelsa Central, one of the largest senatorial districts in terms of land mass and voters’ strength, the key battle will be in Southern Ijaw, where Sylva’s running mate, Joshua MacIver hails from.</p>



<p><br>Yenagoa, made up of the three local governments, will also be a place where an upset cannot be ruled out. With Eradiri and the Labour Party’s pressure, votes may likely be divided among the three contenders. Reasons being that Eradiri’s LP is targeting the youths, made up of over 70 percent of eligible voters in the state capital.<br>Though it is expected that Diri will get the majority of the votes in Opokuma Local Government Area, being his own local government. Diri looks good to win Bayelsa Central and ultimately return for a second term.</p>

The leading contestants are Usman Ododo of the APC, Dino Melaye of the PDP and Murtala Ajaka of the SDP. Analysts argue that the three candidates are from different ethnic backgrounds, namely Ebira, Okun and Igala, respectively and that the voting pattern may likely reflect the same. While APC will dictate the pace in Kogi central, the SDP will make a huge statement in Kogi East and PDP will dominate Kogi West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsman Ododo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOdodo was, in the last seven and half years, the Local Government Auditor General of Kogi State before his emergence as the flag bearer of the APC. He hails from Okene (Kogi Central) just as the outgoing governor.\u003cbr\u003eOdodo, an Ebira, is expected to win the five local government areas in the zone.\u003cbr\u003eHe will have it tough in Kogi West, where agitation for power shift is intense. However, based on the dividends of democracy enjoyed in the area under Governor Bello, particularly with the establishment of a university in Kabba, Ododo is expected to get a fairly good number of votes here.\u003cbr\u003eIn Kogi East, the cries of marginalisation and agitations for power shift will deny Ododo significant votes. The influence of the incumbent Deputy Governor, Edward Onoja, and Ododo’s running mate, Joel Oyibo, both from the zone, may however help to attract some votes. The fact that Kogi East has 14 governorship candidates in today’s election may be a plus for Ododo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMurtala Ajaka\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of his inability to secure the governorship ticket on the platform of the APC, Ajaka dumped the party and subsequently emerged as the candidate of SDP. Prior to this time, he was the National Deputy Publicity Secretary of APC. With his emergence, the political observers in Kogi State have argued that it may have altered political permutations, with many in his zone seeking a return to power tagged “Igala Agenda.”\u003cbr\u003eThe rising profile of Ajaka in Kogi East allegedly led to violent clashes between APC and SPD supporters in the state. Ajaka is expected to dominate Kogi East.\u003cbr\u003eIn Kogi West, the presence of SDP is felt in few local government areas but Ajaka will still make an impact. Ajaka’s chances in Kogi Central are very slim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDino Melaye\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDino Melaye’s emergence as PDP’s flag bearer not only split the party, but also resulted in a gale of defections. The big wigs from the Kogi West axis left the party over alleged doctoring of the delegates’ list at the primary. This notwithstanding, Melaye has put his acts together in his determination to wrest power from the APC.\u003cbr\u003eMelaye hails from Aiyetoro Gbede in the Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State. Unfortunately, some leaders of the party in Kogi West are not happy with 2015 episode when Dino played the role of a spoiler, preventing an Okun son becoming the governor after the sudden death of Audu. However, Melaye may still dominate Kogi West. He will struggle to make an impact in Kogi Central and Kogi East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImo State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe key contestants in today’s election in Imo State are incumbent Governor Hope Uzodinma of the APC, Sam Anyanwu of the PDP and Athan Achonu of the Labour Party.

Some say his actions and body language are contributory factors in the violence and uncertainty in the state.\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, there is the populist sentiment that his best had not been good enough for the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat stands out in Uzodinma’s favour is the spread of the APC structures across the length and breadth of Imo State.\u003cbr\u003eFurther enhancing Uzodinma’s chances include the squabbles in the two main opposition parties – PDP and LP.\u003cbr\u003eTwo jokers Uzodinma may finally play include the ethnic card, and the Federal might. The former two-term Senator of Orlu zone, with its 12 LGAs, is the man to beat today.\u003cbr\u003eThe Federal might would equally come in handy for Uzodinma as the APC-led federal government would not be willing to lose Imo, its strongest South-east ally, either to the LP or the PDP.\u003cbr\u003eAPC, as a ruling party is an attractive bait to political elites, some seeking political rehabilitation and revival or as a haven to escape investigation or prosecution for corruption charges. Such big names which had clustered around Uzodinma would bargain for a piece of the pie and support him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAthan Achonu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAchonu is expected to pool the majority of the votes from the Okigwe zone. The Peter Obi LP sentiments would equally enhance Achonu’s chances, especially in the metropolitan capital city of Owerri where collapsing infrastructure, particularly road network, had distanced the people from Uzodinma.\u003cbr\u003eBut the LP is weakened by internal bickering after its hotly contested governorship primary which led to the exodus from the party of several ‘Obedients’ who would have brought the Peter Obi wave to bear on the election.\u003cbr\u003eBesides Ochudo Martin Agbaso, another LP chieftain, General Jack Ogunewe left the party to pick the Action Alliance ticket. Others like Dr Sam Amadi have refused to support Achonu, while some like Dr Fabian Ihekweme, a former Commissioner and one-time gubernatorial candidate had subtly defected to the Uzodinma camp.\u003cbr\u003eA decisive Mindshift by the people and a high turnout of voters might favour the LP candidate, but there are fears that the insecurity scare would checkmate such development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Anyanwu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePDP’s internal bickering, including the Emeka Ihedioha factor, may work against Anyanwu’s chances today. It would seem the absence of Ihedioha in the race united his Mbaise people to solidly line up behind Uzodinma.\u003cbr\u003eThe PDP boasts of widespread structures, but the bickering and sabotage rocking the party had clearly diminished its potential and robbed Anyanwu of the enormous goodwill the party hitherto enjoyed.\u003cbr\u003eFindings show that Ihedioha was able to triumph in 2019 by winning with the largest votes from the nine LGAs of Owerri zone and consolidating with votes from one or two LGs from Orlu and Okigwe zones. Would the same formula work for Anyanwu? Perhaps not.\u003cbr\u003eWhile both Owerri and Okigwe zones are bitter that the Orlu zone has had more than its fair share of the governorship, occupying it for 20 out of 24 years of democracy, they do not have a winning formula that could effectively combine their joint 15 LGAs against Orlu’s 12, thus the Uzodimma joker, even as he seems to have votes from Orlu’s 12 LGAs safely under his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBayelsa State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe leading candidates in Bayelsa State are incumbent governor Douye Diri of the PDP, Timipre Sylva of the APC and Udengs Eradiri of the LP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDouye Diri\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiri, a former teacher, Organising Secretary of the Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC), hails from Kolokuma/Okpokuma Local Government Area.
