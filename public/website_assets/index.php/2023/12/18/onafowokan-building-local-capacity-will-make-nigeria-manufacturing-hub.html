<p><strong>Gilbert Ekugbe</strong></p>



<p>The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Coleman Technical Industries Limited, Mr. George Onafowokan, has urged the federal government to replicate the success achieved in the petroleum industry to achieve rapid industrial growth.</p>



<p>Speaking with pressmen, he called for a deliberate and strategic approach to encourage the growth of local factories and the manufacturing of goods instead of mere assembly, saying that by fostering a supportive environment and building local capacity, Nigeria can establish itself as a manufacturing hub, creating more opportunities for businesses and economic growth.</p>



<p>However, speaking on the company&#8217;s journey to success, Onafowokan shared that Coleman Wires and Cables started as a small-scale business in 1996 before registering as a company in 1975.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stated that through strategic growth and a vision to become the preferred choice for wires and cables in Nigeria, Coleman gradually expanded its operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He noted that recognizing the demand for locally made cables, the company diversified its product range and became the first in Nigeria and West Africa to produce high-voltage cables. &#8220;Today, Coleman&#8217;s products are unmatched in quality and are not produced by any other company in Nigeria, West Africa, and many parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; he boasted.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, he pointed out that Coleman&#8217;s future appears promising, maintaining that the company has several ongoing projects, including the expansion and completion of its Shagamu plant, the establishment of copper and aluminum factories, and a power project to increase capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Coleman also has plans to supply markets in West and Central Africa, with further expansion into East Africa. The company&#8217;s robust export plan aims to boost business figures significantly, contributing to Nigeria&#8217;s economic growth,&#8221; he said.</p>
