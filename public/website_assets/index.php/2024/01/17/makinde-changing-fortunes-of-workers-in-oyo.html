<p><em><strong>Kemi Olaitan</strong> writes that civil servants and by extension some Nigerians have continued to applaud Governor Seyi Makinde, for his gesture of paying 13th month salary to workers in Oyo state since the last five years.</em></p>



<p>In the recent past and of recent, most states in the country have always been in the news no thanks to the crises they often found themselves over regular payment of salary to workers. Indeed, in these states the leadership of the labour unions often engaged in ‘war’ with some of the governors who owe the workers salary arrears running into months.</p>



<p>The war which has not abated has led workers embarking on strike actions in some of the states. However for workers in Oyo State, they have been having what can be described as a chummy relationship with Governor SeyiMakinde since his administration came into office on May 29, 2019.</p>



<p>Apart from ensuring that workers and pensioners in the state receive their pay which many regard as mandatory for any government on or before the 25th of every month, Makinde has also been paying 13th month salary for all workers in the state since December 2019 with that of this year not an exception.</p>



<p>Indeed, the governor has assured that his administration will pay the 13th month salary to workers in the state for the fifth year running, noting that workers will receive the payment before December 31.</p>



<p>Makinde, while speaking at the State’s 2023 Christmas Carol Service and Nine Lessons Service, held at the Remembrance Arcade, Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, with the theme, “Unto us a child is born”, said this was in spite of the fact that the government had earlier paid the December 2023 salary and the December wage award of N25,000 to workers and N15,000 to pensioners.</p>



<p>He maintained that his administration will continue to prioritise the welfare of workers, infrastructure development and other critical sectors in the state, noting that whatever success his government has achieved was due to the contributions of all members of his team and the civil servants.</p>



<p>According to him, “To my team, I want to say thank you for your support throughout the year and even for the civil servants. Whatever we might have achieved were jointly achieved. For four years running, we paid 13th month salary. And again, we will pay the 13th month salary before the end of the year.”</p>



<p>Makinde who took delight in what he was doing to make the workers in the state happy, disclosed on his authenticated X account,&nbsp; “Tonight, we celebrated the 2023 Festival of Carols and Nine Lessons under the theme ‘Unto Us a Child is Born.’ It provided us with another occasion to express gratitude to God for His mercies and faithfulness throughout this challenging year economically.</p>



<p>“Consistent with our practice since 2019, I want to assure the civil servants in Oyo State that, once again, we will be disbursing the 13th-month salary before the close of this year.”</p>



<p>One of the leaders of the labour unions in the state while speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the gesture by the governor to pay workers 13th month salary is a welcome development which has made workers in the state to see him as a gift to them. According to him, paying the 13th month salary which is the fifth since Makinde became governor in 2019 has ensured that workers continued to celebrate Christmas and new year with joy that they would have money to spend.</p>



<p>He said, “Governor Makinde has made himself a delight to workers in the state with the payment of 13th month salary for five years running. This action of his has gone a long way to ensure that workers in the state celebrate the yuletide season with the confidence that they have extra money at hand.”</p>



<p>On his part, a civil servant, Mr. GbenroOgunyemi, lauded the governor to high heaven, describing Governor Makinde as the best thing to happen to the state as he is a leader that cares about the interest of not only the workers but the entire people of the state.</p>



<p>His words, “The administration of Governor SeyiMakinde has kept its promise of payment of 13th month salary despite the economic crisis and has not defaulted from its responsibility while some state governments are defaulting regarding prompt payment of their workers. Kudos to Mr Governor for being faithful to the workers.</p>



<p>“For me, this is exactly what we get when we have competent hands at the helm of affairs as we have never had it this good before in our dear state. The other name of Governor Makinde is Omoluabi and this is not because of any other thing but his godliness and commitment to serve the people. The governor has continued to exhibit quality leadership as he is simple yet strategic; disciplined and visionary, progressive-minded and a bridge-builder. He is a man with consummate and exemplary personality and I pray that God will continue to strengthen him for us so that the state can have more of his good governance and kind gesture.”</p>



<p>Nigerians have also taken to the social media in reaction to the action of Governor Makinde to pay workers in the pace setter state 13th month salary. These include Odunharry,</p>



<p>Good one. Other states should do same; Rejouir, How is this even news? Should workers jubilate over this. The level of illiteracy in this country is so shameful and Olarewaju89, Good gesture people’s governor.</p>



<p>Other reactions are UnknownT, 13th month actually belongs to the workers. It is a part of their salary deducted monthly and paid in bulk in December. God will punish employers (Governors included) who deduct it and don’t pay it; Bliss52, SinceAjimobi started it, it has been annual; Isaaczik, Alex Otti was the first Governor to pay 13th month. PDP continue to cry there is no free money for you.</p>



<p>Jason, Delta State no carry last o. Follow Governor Makinde of Oyo State; Kosiebe,</p>



<p>Delta my state, what are you waiting for. Clueless Governor. Are you not seeing other Governors; Israelmao, Makinde is doing well in regular payment of pensions and salaries; LegendHero, This has been happening in Oyo state for over 12 years or so. From Ajimobi, they have always paid 13month salary. Makinde also continued the legacy which is great. God bless Makinde, God bless Oyo State.”</p>



<p>For political watchers in the pace setter state, for Governor Makinde to consistently pay the 13th month salary to every worker across the state for over four years is nothing but a reflection of his committment and understanding of the importance of rewarding and motivating the workforce. Indeed, to them by announcing that the payment will be made before the end of the year, he is ensuring that workers can plan and enjoy the holiday season without financial stress.</p>



<p>Similarly, the decision to pay the 13th month salary for the fifth year running showcases the commitment of Makinde to the welfare of workers in Oyo State as the announcement made during the Christmas season, will undoubtedly bring joy and relief to the hardworking employees.</p>



<p>With Governor Makinde having over three years to the end of his tenure, analysts however believed that time would tell whether he would pay the 13th month salary for the entire duration of his tenure as two- term governor of the pace setter state.</p>

Indeed, in these states the leadership of the labour unions often engaged in ‘war’ with some of the governors who owe the workers salary arrears running into months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe war which has not abated has led workers embarking on strike actions in some of the states. However for workers in Oyo State, they have been having what can be described as a chummy relationship with Governor SeyiMakinde since his administration came into office on May 29, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApart from ensuring that workers and pensioners in the state receive their pay which many regard as mandatory for any government on or before the 25th of every month, Makinde has also been paying 13th month salary for all workers in the state since December 2019 with that of this year not an exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the governor has assured that his administration will pay the 13th month salary to workers in the state for the fifth year running, noting that workers will receive the payment before December 31.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMakinde, while speaking at the State’s 2023 Christmas Carol Service and Nine Lessons Service, held at the Remembrance Arcade, Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, with the theme, “Unto us a child is born”, said this was in spite of the fact that the government had earlier paid the December 2023 salary and the December wage award of N25,000 to workers and N15,000 to pensioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe maintained that his administration will continue to prioritise the welfare of workers, infrastructure development and other critical sectors in the state, noting that whatever success his government has achieved was due to the contributions of all members of his team and the civil servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to him, “To my team, I want to say thank you for your support throughout the year and even for the civil servants. Whatever we might have achieved were jointly achieved. For four years running, we paid 13th month salary. And again, we will pay the 13th month salary before the end of the year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMakinde who took delight in what he was doing to make the workers in the state happy, disclosed on his authenticated X account,\u0026nbsp; “Tonight, we celebrated the 2023 Festival of Carols and Nine Lessons under the theme ‘Unto Us a Child is Born.’ It provided us with another occasion to express gratitude to God for His mercies and faithfulness throughout this challenging year economically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Consistent with our practice since 2019, I want to assure the civil servants in Oyo State that, once again, we will be disbursing the 13th-month salary before the close of this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the leaders of the labour unions in the state while speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the gesture by the governor to pay workers 13th month salary is a welcome development which has made workers in the state to see him as a gift to them. According to him, paying the 13th month salary which is the fifth since Makinde became governor in 2019 has ensured that workers continued to celebrate Christmas and new year with joy that they would have money to spend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Governor Makinde has made himself a delight to workers in the state with the payment of 13th month salary for five years running. This action of his has gone a long way to ensure that workers in the state celebrate the yuletide season with the confidence that they have extra money at hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn his part, a civil servant, Mr. GbenroOgunyemi, lauded the governor to high heaven, describing Governor Makinde as the best thing to happen to the state as he is a leader that cares about the interest of not only the workers but the entire people of the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis words, “The administration of Governor SeyiMakinde has kept its promise of payment of 13th month salary despite the economic crisis and has not defaulted from its responsibility while some state governments are defaulting regarding prompt payment of their workers. Kudos to Mr Governor for being faithful to the workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“For me, this is exactly what we get when we have competent hands at the helm of affairs as we have never had it this good before in our dear state. The other name of Governor Makinde is Omoluabi and this is not because of any other thing but his godliness and commitment to serve the people. The governor has continued to exhibit quality leadership as he is simple yet strategic; disciplined and visionary, progressive-minded and a bridge-builder. He is a man with consummate and exemplary personality and I pray that God will continue to strengthen him for us so that the state can have more of his good governance and kind gesture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNigerians have also taken to the social media in reaction to the action of Governor Makinde to pay workers in the pace setter state 13th month salary. These include Odunharry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGood one. Other states should do same; Rejouir, How is this even news? Should workers jubilate over this. The level of illiteracy in this country is so shameful and Olarewaju89, Good gesture people’s governor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther reactions are UnknownT, 13th month actually belongs to the workers. It is a part of their salary deducted monthly and paid in bulk in December. God will punish employers (Governors included) who deduct it and don’t pay it; Bliss52, SinceAjimobi started it, it has been annual; Isaaczik, Alex Otti was the first Governor to pay 13th month. PDP continue to cry there is no free money for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJason, Delta State no carry last o. Follow Governor Makinde of Oyo State; Kosiebe,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDelta my state, what are you waiting for. Clueless Governor. Are you not seeing other Governors; Israelmao, Makinde is doing well in regular payment of pensions and salaries; LegendHero, This has been happening in Oyo state for over 12 years or so. From Ajimobi, they have always paid 13month salary. Makinde also continued the legacy which is great. God bless Makinde, God bless Oyo State.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor political watchers in the pace setter state, for Governor Makinde to consistently pay the 13th month salary to every worker across the state for over four years is nothing but a reflection of his committment and understanding of the importance of rewarding and motivating the workforce.
