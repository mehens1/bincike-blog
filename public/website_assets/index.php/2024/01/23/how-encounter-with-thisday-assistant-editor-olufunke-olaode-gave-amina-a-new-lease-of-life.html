<p><strong>Sunday Ehigiator</strong>&nbsp;reports&nbsp;how 36- year-old house-cleaner, Olufunmi Amina, got a new lease on life after a life-changing encounter with an Assistant Editor, THISDAY Newspaper, Olufunke Olaode in 2021</p>



<p>The story of Amina Olufunmi is a typical illustration of “The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the LORD had done this, and it is marvellous in our eyes,” as chronicled in Psalm 118:22-23.</p>



<p>With no friends and abandoned to fate by family members, the hardworking Amina grew to survive off cleaning people&#8217;s homes to make ends meet. Despite learning to trade plumbing materials, the lack of capital to set up her store kept her stagnant for years with no one to call on for help.</p>



<p>However, through diligent cleaning of people’s homes, Amina was recommended to help clean up a home back in 2021, without any iota of knowledge that this would mark a turning point for good in her life trajectory.</p>



<p><strong>Encounter with Funke Olaode</strong></p>



<p>Narrating her encounter with Amina, Funke Olaode, also the Convener, ‘Amina Olufunmi Must Be Empowered initiatives’ said her encounter with Amina Olufunmi was divine.</p>



<p>According to Olufunke, also an indigene of Igbajo in Osun State, “I can tell you that it was God and again her moment had come. I was introduced to Amina three years ago through a family friend. I had these heaps of personal copies of THISDAY Newspapers that had accumulated over the years and I was looking for someone to help arrange it for me and dispose of them.</p>



<p>“When I met her, we got talking, and I was wondering if she was fit to work because of her slim and fragile stature. I was genuinely concerned. However, she was committed to the work I needed her for. So I placed her on salary and was also giving her a daily stipend for her transportation, and food.</p>



<p>“But at some point, I had to ask more about her, especially her background, just to know her more, then she told me her story and she needed help.</p>



<p>“I asked what she would like to do to make ends meet, and she said she had once learnt how to sell plumbing materials at some point but didn&#8217;t have the capital to open her shop.</p>



<p>“But I told her that it is capital intensive that even with N20 million, you haven&#8217;t even started yet.”</p>



<p><strong>Amina Olufunmi Must Be Empowered initiatives</strong></p>



<p>Olaode said having heard her story, she was moved to pull her contacts to ensure Amina was empowered; hence she came up with the ‘Amina Olufunmi Must Be Empowered initiatives’.</p>



<p>Speaking further, Olaode said, “I decided to put words out to a few people I know can help her, I approached former Managing Director of Accenture and Current Chairman of Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), Mr. Niyi Yusuf, who advised that she should be enrolled to acquire skills which would last her a lifetime, and she by herself later decided she was going to learn fashion designing.</p>



<p>“I approached kindhearted Nigerians and they responded. So, through the help of the Ibeji Foundation and its Founder, Alhaji Rafiu Adisa Ebiti, within two days, they enrolled her in a fashion school and also placed her on monthly stipends of N20,000 since 2021.</p>



<p>“The Ibeji Foundation also paid for her accommodation and equally bought her a sewing machine and other sewing materials she would need for her training within the same period.</p>



<p>“It is interesting to note that Alhaji Ebiti has only met her once, but he showed keen interest in helping her and has been committed to the course. He has been monitoring her progression in the training and has never left her alone one bit.</p>



<p>“I never had any idea it would become such a big project when I decided to take up her case. For me, we are who we are by the grace of God. I know how far God has brought me, even as a journalist. I am a benefactor of God&#8217;s grace. Hence, when her matter came up, four things came to mind.</p>



<p>“First, we rise by lifting others. Secondly, if you want to tackle poverty, you must start from the grassroots. To empower her so that she can replicate her testimony in another person&#8217;s life and take another person off the street. Lastly, she is a Moslem and I am a Christian but humanity doesn&#8217;t know religion.</p>



<p>“I must also thank the management of NASFAT Agency for Zakat and Sadaqat (NAZAS) an offshoot of NASFAT, an Islamic basedIslamic-based organization for rising to the occasion. The agency bought sewing equipment worth over N600,000, including industrial stoning machines, sewing machines, and whipping machines.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Alhaji Ebiti, apart from sponsoring her two and half years of training also paid N300,000 for her shop, while the CEO of Caverton Offshore Support Group, Mr Olabode Makanjuola through his company&#8217;s Corporate Social Responsibility supported her generously.</p>



<p>“NAZAS met her for the first time during the presentation but still did so much for her based on the recommendation and trust they have in me. I want to thank Mr. Niyi Yusuf, Alhaji Ebiti, Mr Olabode Makanjuola, for all their interventions on Amina.</p>



<p>“I also thank her boss, Madam Hanna Makanjuola, CEO of Hanna Tee Unisex Fashion Designer, for training her like a big sister and never got tired of her. I am grateful.”</p>



<p><strong>Encounter with Hana Tee Fashion School</strong></p>



<p>Speaking about Amina’s time at her fashion school, the CEO, Hana Tee Unisex Fashion Designer, Mrs Hannah Makanjuola said, “I have been in the fashion business for 17 years and have trained a lot of apprentices. Amina would be the 44th person who has gotten my graduation certificate.</p>



<p>“When she first arrived for training, I never wanted to accept her because of how she was looking. But I decided to consider her on trial, and I thank God I did. Amina isn&#8217;t a troublesome person. She is humble, quiet, and very religious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She is a very dedicated Muslim and was the 13th apprentice I registered for her set.</p>



<p>“At first, because of her lack of educational background, it wasn&#8217;t easy to communicate with her effectively, but as time went on, she improved and she is doing better now.</p>



<p>“I must thank Madam Funke, who has always told me that Amina&#8217;s case was a project, and encouraged me to persevere and be patient with her till she was able to catch up.</p>



<p>“She has improved tremendously within the three years she has been under training.&nbsp; Now, she even sows for my customers, and they all like her sowing. I can beat my chest that she will do great exploits in her future endeavours.</p>



<p>“Now that she has all these supports, my advice to Amina is never to lose focus and never to forget anything she learnt throughout training. She should also follow in my footsteps and try to improve on it.</p>



<p>“I will also advise her to maintain all the equipment that she has been given. Not all apprentices are this fortunate to have anyone bless them with these tools after graduation. It took many designers years of savings to be able to afford them.</p>



<p>“Also, be prayerful and learn to save and be perfect in all your work. Don&#8217;t let people see your mistakes and don’t let people complain about your work and work ethic. If you can keep to these principles, the sky will be your limit.”</p>



<p><strong>The Big Lessons</strong></p>



<p>Speaking on why he decided to help Amina, NASFAT President, Mr Niyi Yusuf said, Olaode’s action is a big lesson to everyone that you don’t need to be related to anyone before you help them.</p>



<p>According to him, “The truth is that the lady was introduced to me by Funke Olaode, and I said yes because I was amazed at her keen interest in someone that is not in any way or form related to her, and the fact that she has been supporting her for quite a while, and also gotten a few other donors to support her.</p>



<p>“For me, I just thought that it was intriguing to see Funke take on such an assignment that no one has given her by supporting others when I am sure that even she needs help in one form or the other. That was the main thing that struck me.</p>



<p>“It is a lesson for many of us that we should not just focus on helping ourselves and our family, but also seek to help others like Funke has just done.</p>



<p>“So it is a big lesson we learnt from her, and I thought it was important to then support her to pull this through even though I have never met the young lady before, Funke&#8217;s integrity, reputation and passion towards helping the girl were enough to convince me to support her.”</p>



<p><strong>NAZAS Intervention</strong></p>



<p>Speaking further during the equipment handing over ceremony to Amina by NASFAT Agency for Zakat and Sadaqat (NAZAS), which was held over the weekend, at the NAZAS head office located along CMD road Lagos, Yusuf said, “What is happening today is part of the activities of NAZAS, as it decided to support the lady.</p>



<p>“She filled out the request form, she listed the things she wanted, she was interviewed, her background was checked, and NAZAS felt it was a credible request, and NAZAS then went to the market to buy the equipment which is being handed over today.</p>



<p>“NAZAS has spent over half a billion Naira in the last seven years in supporting the needy, both Muslims and non-Muslims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My advice to Amina is that she should use those equipment for the purpose for which they were procured. As you know, she has undergone training, which is important, which means she has skills now and can use the equipment.</p>



<p>“So she should ensure she uses them for the purpose for which they were bought and not go and keep them under her bed.</p>



<p>“Secondly, I&#8217;ll advise her to also help others, just as she has been helped. Not necessarily her family. She must also help others to the limit of her ability.</p>



<p>“Lastly, she must put all her talents to use, including seeking assistance from Madam Funke and many others so that she can quickly grow her business.”</p>



<p><strong>NAZAS Impact</strong></p>



<p>Speaking about NAZAS&#8217; impact on society, the General Manager of NAZAS, Mufutau Adelotan noted that NAZAS is an offshoot of the NASFAT group worldwide.</p>



<p>“We came into existence in 2014, and we will be marking our 10th anniversary soonest.</p>



<p>“Since 2014, we have raised over N700 million in Zakat and Sadaka funds and have disbursed close to N600 million to indigent people in the community in areas of empowerment,&nbsp; which is part of why we are here today, scholarships and education.</p>



<p>“Right now, we have over 200 students on our scholarship programme in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions all over the country.</p>



<p>“NAZAS is also now outside Nigeria.&nbsp; We have a zone in Ivory Coast, and hopefully, this year, we should be opening our branches in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do empowerment, scholarship, and support the health sector.&nbsp; Under the health initiatives, there are two schemes; we have the HMO for Muslims who are not able to cater for themselves health-wise, so we give them the health scheme through the Lagos State Health Management Board. With just N40,000, we registered a family of six for a premium health package for a whole year.</p>



<p>“We also pay for hospital bills and debt relief.&nbsp; We clear the debts of some Muslims who are in debt for genuine reasons and intentions such as school, business, or health challenges.</p>



<p>“Lastly, we give the aged monthly stipends of N10,000 to support their feeding. It&#8217;s like just paying them a pension. As we pay our staff salary, we pay them as well, just to support their living as they can no longer work or make a living. And we get a lot of prayers from them. We only have to confirm if they are still alive every month, and then we pay them without them coming to queue up anywhere. They just get alerts monthly.”</p>



<p><strong>Encounter with Amina</strong></p>



<p>As regards Amina, Adelotan said, “In NAZAS, we don&#8217;t have to know you. We approach Muslims anywhere they are and also get donations from Muslims all over the world without them meeting us in person.</p>



<p>“I must tell you, in her case, somebody paid for all this equipment we are giving to her, which cost over N500,000. The person said he wanted to remain anonymous. So we don&#8217;t have to know the beneficiary.</p>



<p>“The way we run is, come and pick up a form with us if you need help, fill the form. We have a committee we call a technical committee.&nbsp; They access your form and interview you, and once they find you okay, they recommend you for help.</p>



<p>“Also, in the Holy Quran, there are people that Allah recommended that you must give Zakat to, and I believe she is one of them as those who are in need.</p>



<p>“Today, she is benefitting in two different ways from our scheme. She is benefiting from the empowerment scheme, in which we are giving her equipment to support her training, which is fashion design.</p>



<p>“She is also benefiting from the Train to Fund scheme.&nbsp; This one, we brought it up two years ago after discovering that some people we empower sometimes abandon the equipment after a while or sell it off, and keep begging again.</p>



<p>“According to Islam, once you have given out Zakat, it&#8217;s not in your place to go and monitor what the person does with the help afterwards.</p>



<p>“So we thought about other acceptable means by which we can follow up with beneficiaries. Hence, we partnered one of our agencies in NASFAT, ADEK Academy,&nbsp; and the economic empowerment committee of NASFAT and others, such as the lady who trained Amina, to help us monitor their progress, and also know if they require more help along the way so we can still step in.</p>



<p>“So, with the new scheme, we can mentor them, guide them, and monitor the level of their progress.&nbsp; We teach them about the management of tools, income, and savings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“So she still needs to be trained in money and financial management, which we will imbibe in her when that time comes. So we are happy to assist people who are in need at all times. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we congratulate Amina for this great feat because so many people are out there looking for this opportunity but couldn&#8217;t get it or know how to get to us. So she is lucky, and we congratulate her.</p>



<p>“My advice to her is that she should justify the actions of everyone who believed in her and donated to help her by taking her job seriously, continuous improvement, and also giving back to society just as she was freely given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As time goes on, she should also learn to pay her Zakat and contribute positively to the lives of people around her. It is not just about money, sometimes, free training and making yourself available to render your expertise is also a way of giving back.”</p>



<p><strong>Ibeji Foundation Reacts&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Speaking on behalf of Ibeji Foundation and its Founder, Alhaji Rafiu Ebiti, General Manager, Ibeji Foundation, Rafiat Gbadamosi said, “Amina is like our own child at Ibeji Foundation. After hearing her story about 3 years ago, we started paying her monthly stipends, enrolled her to learn a skill, housed her, and helped to get her a shop where she could start making ends meet herself.</p>



<p>“Amina&#8217;s case is exceptional. She is like a project to us. We are so interested and invested in her, and we would not leave her to dry even though she can stand on her own.</p>



<p>“This is what the Ibeji Foundation, Founded by Alhaji Rafiu Ebiti, is all about. We are very passionate about humanity and helping the needy, and not just about giving one money, but real empowerment.</p>



<p>“With all the training Amina has received, we are certain that she can also empower others just as she is being empowered.”</p>



<p><strong>Amina’s Intervention, a Testament to our CSR</strong></p>



<p>Also speaking about Amina, the CEO of Caverton Offshore Support Group, Mr Olabode Makanjuola, said Amina’s intervention was a testament to the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</p>



<p>“When my dear sister Funke approached me about this young lady and what she was trying to achieve, we just thought of yielding to our CSR initiatives that we have done in the past.</p>



<p>“Education is very key and very important to the development of any society. And we see the ability of people who get educated and want to go into any form of employment, be it vocational or corporate. We just support them.</p>



<p>“We are happy to do our little bit and contribute our CSR to the development of Amina, and we wish her all the best in her future endeavours. God bless all those who contributed to making this a success.”</p>



<p><strong>A Heart of Gratitude</strong></p>



<p>Expressing her gratitude to all those who came to her aid, Amina said, “I feel elated and excited because dreams come through. It has been a long journey to career attainment because it has been very difficult for me.</p>



<p>“I finished secondary school in 2009. I first of all trained as an apprentice with a building materials merchant at Ijanikin, Lagos State between 2010-2012 but my parents were financially handicapped after graduation there was no money to establish. In the process of raising funds, I&nbsp; did menial jobs including a maid at a restaurant in Oyo town.</p>



<p>“My financial woes persisted until I met a destiny helper in Madam Olufunke. It was her friend, Mrs Biola Omosebi who introduced me to her in February of 2021. She was touched by my predicament and promised to do something.</p>



<p>“She did. And today from doing menial jobs I am now a fashion entrepreneur. I want to seize this opportunity to thank the chairman of lbeji Foundation, Alhaji Rafiu Ebiti whom I only met once and who acted like my father till I graduated.</p>



<p>“Apart from paying for my accommodation, the foundation has been giving me a monthly stipend for upkeep since 2021 till I graduated this month. Ibeji Foundation also paid over 300K for my shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The President of NASFAT Alhaji Niyi Yusuf was kind and generous. And through NAZAS, I was provided with all the vocational tools needed to take off. Mr Olabode Makanjuola, CEO of Caverton Offshore Support Group who I never met, paid for my graduation and refreshment of N200,000.</p>



<p>“Through Madam Olufunke, my life became a roller coaster. God will bless those who have supported me to become somebody in life when all hope was lost. I promise to make an impact in the Nigerian fashion space through the help of God so I can give back.”</p>

That was the main thing that struck me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It is a lesson for many of us that we should not just focus on helping ourselves and our family, but also seek to help others like Funke has just done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So it is a big lesson we learnt from her, and I thought it was important to then support her to pull this through even though I have never met the young lady before, Funke\u0026#8217;s integrity, reputation and passion towards helping the girl were enough to convince me to support her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNAZAS Intervention\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking further during the equipment handing over ceremony to Amina by NASFAT Agency for Zakat and Sadaqat (NAZAS), which was held over the weekend, at the NAZAS head office located along CMD road Lagos, Yusuf said, “What is happening today is part of the activities of NAZAS, as it decided to support the lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“She filled out the request form, she listed the things she wanted, she was interviewed, her background was checked, and NAZAS felt it was a credible request, and NAZAS then went to the market to buy the equipment which is being handed over today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“NAZAS has spent over half a billion Naira in the last seven years in supporting the needy, both Muslims and non-Muslims.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“My advice to Amina is that she should use those equipment for the purpose for which they were procured. As you know, she has undergone training, which is important, which means she has skills now and can use the equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So she should ensure she uses them for the purpose for which they were bought and not go and keep them under her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Secondly, I\u0026#8217;ll advise her to also help others, just as she has been helped. Not necessarily her family. She must also help others to the limit of her ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Lastly, she must put all her talents to use, including seeking assistance from Madam Funke and many others so that she can quickly grow her business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNAZAS Impact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking about NAZAS\u0026#8217; impact on society, the General Manager of NAZAS, Mufutau Adelotan noted that NAZAS is an offshoot of the NASFAT group worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We came into existence in 2014, and we will be marking our 10th anniversary soonest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Since 2014, we have raised over N700 million in Zakat and Sadaka funds and have disbursed close to N600 million to indigent people in the community in areas of empowerment,\u0026nbsp; which is part of why we are here today, scholarships and education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now, we have over 200 students on our scholarship programme in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions all over the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“NAZAS is also now outside Nigeria.\u0026nbsp; We have a zone in Ivory Coast, and hopefully, this year, we should be opening our branches in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the USA.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We do empowerment, scholarship, and support the health sector.\u0026nbsp; Under the health initiatives, there are two schemes; we have the HMO for Muslims who are not able to cater for themselves health-wise, so we give them the health scheme through the Lagos State Health Management Board. With just N40,000, we registered a family of six for a premium health package for a whole year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We also pay for hospital bills and debt relief.\u0026nbsp; We clear the debts of some Muslims who are in debt for genuine reasons and intentions such as school, business, or health challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Lastly, we give the aged monthly stipends of N10,000 to support their feeding. It\u0026#8217;s like just paying them a pension. As we pay our staff salary, we pay them as well, just to support their living as they can no longer work or make a living. And we get a lot of prayers from them. We only have to confirm if they are still alive every month, and then we pay them without them coming to queue up anywhere. They just get alerts monthly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncounter with Amina\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs regards Amina, Adelotan said, “In NAZAS, we don\u0026#8217;t have to know you. We approach Muslims anywhere they are and also get donations from Muslims all over the world without them meeting us in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I must tell you, in her case, somebody paid for all this equipment we are giving to her, which cost over N500,000. The person said he wanted to remain anonymous. So we don\u0026#8217;t have to know the beneficiary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The way we run is, come and pick up a form with us if you need help, fill the form. We have a committee we call a technical committee.\u0026nbsp; They access your form and interview you, and once they find you okay, they recommend you for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, in the Holy Quran, there are people that Allah recommended that you must give Zakat to, and I believe she is one of them as those who are in need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Today, she is benefitting in two different ways from our scheme. She is benefiting from the empowerment scheme, in which we are giving her equipment to support her training, which is fashion design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“She is also benefiting from the Train to Fund scheme.\u0026nbsp; This one, we brought it up two years ago after discovering that some people we empower sometimes abandon the equipment after a while or sell it off, and keep begging again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“According to Islam, once you have given out Zakat, it\u0026#8217;s not in your place to go and monitor what the person does with the help afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So we thought about other acceptable means by which we can follow up with beneficiaries. Hence, we partnered one of our agencies in NASFAT, ADEK Academy,\u0026nbsp; and the economic empowerment committee of NASFAT and others, such as the lady who trained Amina, to help us monitor their progress, and also know if they require more help along the way so we can still step in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So, with the new scheme, we can mentor them, guide them, and monitor the level of their progress.\u0026nbsp; We teach them about the management of tools, income, and savings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“So she still needs to be trained in money and financial management, which we will imbibe in her when that time comes. So we are happy to assist people who are in need at all times. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So we congratulate Amina for this great feat because so many people are out there looking for this opportunity but couldn\u0026#8217;t get it or know how to get to us. So she is lucky, and we congratulate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“My advice to her is that she should justify the actions of everyone who believed in her and donated to help her by taking her job seriously, continuous improvement, and also giving back to society just as she was freely given.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“As time goes on, she should also learn to pay her Zakat and contribute positively to the lives of people around her. It is not just about money, sometimes, free training and making yourself available to render your expertise is also a way of giving back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIbeji Foundation Reacts\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking on behalf of Ibeji Foundation and its Founder, Alhaji Rafiu Ebiti, General Manager, Ibeji Foundation, Rafiat Gbadamosi said, “Amina is like our own child at Ibeji Foundation.

I first of all trained as an apprentice with a building materials merchant at Ijanikin, Lagos State between 2010-2012 but my parents were financially handicapped after graduation there was no money to establish.

And today from doing menial jobs I am now a fashion entrepreneur.
