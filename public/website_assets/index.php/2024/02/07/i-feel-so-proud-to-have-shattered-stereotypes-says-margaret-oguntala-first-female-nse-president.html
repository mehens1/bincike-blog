At the same time, being the first female President comes with a sense of responsibility to effectively represent the interests of all NSE members, regardless of gender. I am committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the engineering profession, advocating for equal opportunities and recognition for all engineers, regardless of their backgrounds. As a woman and mother, who embraces the responsibility of nurturing life, I am determined to nurture engineering to new heights, by rebirthing the NSE for the Growth, Empowerment, and Advancement of Engineering in Nigeria. Overall, being the first female President of the NSE has been a profound empowering experience, allowing me to contribute to positive change in engineering and inspire others to believe in the limitless potential of women in Engineering.</p>



<p><strong>Tell us your plans to make Nigerian Engineers relevant in nation building?</strong></p>



<p>NSE is now on a transformative journey to elevate Engineering in Nigeria and as the President of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, I am deeply committed to advancing the role of Nigerian Engineers in nation building and ensuring their relevance in addressing the challenges facing our dear country. Let me tell you some of our strategic roadmap outlining our priorities. We are prioritising initiatives aimed at enhancing the capacity, skills and competencies of Nigerian engineers, especially the young engineers to meet the evolving needs of the industry. We have started walking the talk. Right now, we are about to conclude with our partners on international training, world-class workshops and certification programmes. These will commence in a few weeks time. Also, it is our plan to champion initiatives that foster innovation and research within the engineering community, with a focus on a developing homegrown solution to local challenges. We are creating platforms for collaboration between engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs, as well as support innovative projects and start up. We already have an engineering hub which we intend to scale up. Our goal is to position Nigeria as a hub for engineering. In addition, we have started contacting government agencies, policy makers, and stakeholders showing interest to work together and advocate for policies that promote the growth and development of the engineering profession in Nigeria. This includes but is not limited to advocating for increased investment in infrastructure, adoption of innovative technologies, and the implementation of sustainable development practices. Let me also add that we are prioritising Vocational Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (VSTEM) education to empower future leaders. We are supporting dedicated institutions with strategic endowments to ensure the thriving of VSTEM education for a generation of STEM leaders. For a greater Nigeria, we shall uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethics within the profession, including adherence to codes of conduct, ethics, and best practices. We shall raise public awareness about the importance of engineering in nation–building and engaging with local communities to address their needs and concerns. Overall, we shall harness the collective expertise, passion, and ingenuity of Nigerian Engineers to drive sustainable development, economic growth, and social progress in Nigeria. Together, we will build a brighter future for our country and leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.</p>



<p><strong>Give us an idea of how much Nigeria&#8217;s engineering firms have been affected by the nation&#8217;s struggling economy</strong></p>



<p>The impact of Nigeria’s struggling economy on engineering firms has been significant, with several challenges affecting their operations. Engineering firms in Nigeria often face high operating costs, including expenses related to energy, transportation and security. The economic challenges facing the country such as inflation and rising fuel prices, have further increased these operating costs, squeezing profit margins for engineering firms. Access to financing is another challenge for many engineering firms in Nigeria, particularly small and medium–sized enterprises (SMEs). Financial Institutions now hesitate to lend to engineering firms due to concerns about economic stability. Also, Nigeria’s economy has experienced significant currency fluctuations in recent years, with the depreciation of the naira against major currencies. Engineering firms especially those that import some materials from abroad now face higher costs due to the weakened purchasing power of the naira, affecting their profitability and competitiveness. In summary, the struggling economy in Nigeria has presented numerous challenges for engineering firms impacting their ability to grow, innovate, and contribute to the country’s development. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from government and industry stakeholders to create a more conducive business environment and support the growth and sustainability of engineering firms in Nigeria.</p>



<p><strong>What role can engineers play in the nation&#8217;s infrastructural development? Can some of them form a consortium that can bid for government jobs and prove they can compete with other firms?</strong></p>



<p>Nigerian engineers play a pivotal role in the nation’s infrastructural development across various sectors, including transportation, energy, water resources, telecommunications, and urban development. Some of the key roles that Nigeria Engineers undertake in contributing to infrastructural development is the Designing and planning of infrastructure projects in order to meet the needs of communities while adhering to regulatory standards and environmental sustainability principles. They also oversee the construction and implementation of infrastructure projects, maintenance and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure assets, ensuring their functionality, safety and efficiency. Engineers drive innovation and technology adoption in infrastructural development by leveraging advancement in material, construction techniques and digital technologies. Regarding forming a consortium to bid for government jobs, Yes. Nigerian Engineers can form consortium to bid for government contracts and compete with other firms. By pooling their resources, expertise, and capabilities, engineers can demonstrate their collective capacity to undertake large – scale projects and address the infrastructure challenges facing Nigeria and driving sustainable growth and development.</p>



<p><strong>Nigeria is grappling with insecurity. How can engineers help?</strong></p>



<p>Engineers can play a significant role in addressing insecurity in Nigeria by contributing their technical expertise, innovation, and problem-solving skills to develop and implement solutions aimed at enhancing security and stability. Engineers can design and implement technologies and infrastructure to enhance border security, including surveillance systems, fencing checkpoints, and border control facilities. By improving border surveillance and monitoring capabilities, engineers can help prevent illegal border crossings, human trafficking, and the smuggling of weapons and contraband. Also, Engineers can leverage technology and innovation to develop new tools, systems, and solutions to enhance security and counter insecurity threats. This includes development of drones for aerial surveillance, biometric identification systems for border control and data analytics platforms for intelligence analysis and threat detection. I can confidently tell you that engineers have a crucial role to play in addressing insecurity in Nigeria by leveraging their technical expertise, creativity and problem-solving skills to develop and implement innovative solutions that enhance security, resilience, and stability in communities across the country. Collaborations between engineers, government, civil society organisations are essential to effectively address the multifaceted challenges of insecurity and promote peace in Nigeria.</p>



<p><strong>Many young engineers can&#8217;t find work in engineering firms, even Corpers and students seeking industrial attachment. How can you change this narrative?</strong></p>



<p>Changing the narrative of young engineers struggling to find work in engineering firms, including corps members and students seeking industrial attachment, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both short–term challenges and long term structural issues. We are working on different strategies, including strengthening industry–academia collaboration, expanding internship and industrial attachment opportunities, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, enhancing career guidance and counselling, address structural barriers and bias, encouraging professional development and certification, After implementing all these strategies and fostering collaborations between stakeholders across the engineering ecosystem, we would have changed the narratives and create more opportunities for young engineers to thrive and contribute to the country’s development.</p>



<p><strong>Give us your opinion on other national issues&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Nigeria faces various challenges ranging from security, economic diversification, infrastructure deficit, access to quality education and health services, among others.

We are supporting dedicated institutions with strategic endowments to ensure the thriving of VSTEM education for a generation of STEM leaders. For a greater Nigeria, we shall uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethics within the profession, including adherence to codes of conduct, ethics, and best practices. We shall raise public awareness about the importance of engineering in nation–building and engaging with local communities to address their needs and concerns. Overall, we shall harness the collective expertise, passion, and ingenuity of Nigerian Engineers to drive sustainable development, economic growth, and social progress in Nigeria. Together, we will build a brighter future for our country and leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGive us an idea of how much Nigeria\u0026#8217;s engineering firms have been affected by the nation\u0026#8217;s struggling economy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of Nigeria’s struggling economy on engineering firms has been significant, with several challenges affecting their operations. Engineering firms in Nigeria often face high operating costs, including expenses related to energy, transportation and security. The economic challenges facing the country such as inflation and rising fuel prices, have further increased these operating costs, squeezing profit margins for engineering firms. Access to financing is another challenge for many engineering firms in Nigeria, particularly small and medium–sized enterprises (SMEs). Financial Institutions now hesitate to lend to engineering firms due to concerns about economic stability. Also, Nigeria’s economy has experienced significant currency fluctuations in recent years, with the depreciation of the naira against major currencies. Engineering firms especially those that import some materials from abroad now face higher costs due to the weakened purchasing power of the naira, affecting their profitability and competitiveness. In summary, the struggling economy in Nigeria has presented numerous challenges for engineering firms impacting their ability to grow, innovate, and contribute to the country’s development. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from government and industry stakeholders to create a more conducive business environment and support the growth and sustainability of engineering firms in Nigeria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat role can engineers play in the nation\u0026#8217;s infrastructural development? Can some of them form a consortium that can bid for government jobs and prove they can compete with other firms?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNigerian engineers play a pivotal role in the nation’s infrastructural development across various sectors, including transportation, energy, water resources, telecommunications, and urban development. Some of the key roles that Nigeria Engineers undertake in contributing to infrastructural development is the Designing and planning of infrastructure projects in order to meet the needs of communities while adhering to regulatory standards and environmental sustainability principles. They also oversee the construction and implementation of infrastructure projects, maintenance and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure assets, ensuring their functionality, safety and efficiency. Engineers drive innovation and technology adoption in infrastructural development by leveraging advancement in material, construction techniques and digital technologies. Regarding forming a consortium to bid for government jobs, Yes. Nigerian Engineers can form consortium to bid for government contracts and compete with other firms. By pooling their resources, expertise, and capabilities, engineers can demonstrate their collective capacity to undertake large – scale projects and address the infrastructure challenges facing Nigeria and driving sustainable growth and development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNigeria is grappling with insecurity.
