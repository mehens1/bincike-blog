<p>Nigerian actor and multi-talented personality, Tobi Bakre, catapulted to stardom following his impressive run as a finalist on the Big Brother Naija (Season 3) reality TV show in 2018. Since then, he has worked in various areas of the entertainment industry and making waves as an actor with several blockbuster productions. In an exclusive interview with&nbsp;<strong>Tosin Clegg,</strong>&nbsp;Tobi delves into his journey to fame, his numerous award wins, strategies for staying relevant in the industry, and much more</p>



<p>H<strong>ow does the Berlinale Talents selection impact your career, and what are you looking forward to the most in this talent development program?</strong></p>



<p>The fact that I was chosen was a win for me. It was actually Lala, my first and only acting coach that asked me to apply and I gave it a trial. I love things that would open your mind and you can only open your mind when you are exposed. So I yearned for the exposure and decided to apply as you had to submit some of the projects you have done. So it’s a good one and a platform to showcase Nigeria again to the world because we are now being globally accepted in terms of our creativity. For me it’s just to go there, network and let them see what we do over here and learn how they do things so we can find a way to partner. And I feel that’s the ultimate win for everybody, collaborations. It’s a global village now and the kind of stories we can tell would be richer and relatable globally.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share some key experiences or challenges you faced during your transformation as an actor and how has it shaped your approach to the industry?</strong></p>



<p>For me acting was never in my script after Big Brother and of course I used to love Nigerian movies growing up. I knew I wanted to go for Big Brother but afterwards I was just opened to anything that comes as I work hard. When I started acting I just fell in love with the whole process because I see what happens when they send you the scripts, I see what happens when we are reading and the whole manual process. The camera angles, the different takes, the edit, the colour, effects and all of those things then you see the end product and actually get to watch the audience enjoy the creativity. The first few times were challenging I won’t lie as immediately I was thrown into hot soup as I was acting with the likes of Maurice Sam, Sola Sobowale and a few others. You are a newbie but you have to pick up fast and I had to watch them closely to try and deliver. Gradually I got more comfortable and after doing that I got unto other projects that gave me the leverage that this is achievable.</p>



<p><strong>How do you choose roles, and what aspects of a script or character appeal to you the most when deciding to take on a project?</strong></p>



<p>Then at the time and in all honesty it was more of the opportunities. When I started off it was wherever and whoever was ready to give me an opportunity I was ready to go there and show that I can do this has there is talent, I’m hardworking and I can perform. But now it has translated and it came from the fact that some people took a chance on me &#8211; Jade Osiberu, Lala, Kunle Afolayan &#8211; and this was an opportunity for me to learn and for me to show again what I could do. For all the scripts I have done that eventually comes out and have people appreciative of the arts there is a way it makes you feel. For me it’s the scripts before we get to the numbers, availability and I think to myself is this interesting to read, is this pushing the boundaries and I like talking to the writers too when I get the opportunities so I can understand their own creative process. So really, when you read a good script, you will know it’s a good script as there is no two ways about it.</p>



<p><strong>Winning multiple awards in 2023, how does these accolades influence your goals and aspirations in the entertainment industry?</strong></p>



<p>Well I was never in it for the accolades. Genuinely my joy is putting out good work or being part of a project, I can comfortably sit and watch over and over again. You know, I’m a bit selfish, I don’t like to subject arts to the opinions of other people. Because you know it is perspective, what I think is nice, might not be nice to the other person. So for me I am a critic by nature, if I can sit down and enjoy something by watching over and over then it’s fulfillment. I just wanted to come and do good work with people already doing good work. Most of the projects I have been on I have been blessed with the best directors, best production company as everybody is putting great work. And you know you can’t drop the ball so I also come with my own specified input and we are able to make magic. But when the projects are publicly accepted and the accolades are coming I won’t lie it also feels good which is like justification of one’s work. It’s good and feels good to be recognised as it encourages you and it’s a pat on your back to know you are heading on the right direction. I don’t feel I have gotten to my apex where I feel I have done my best as this is still the early stages and the best is yet to come.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;How do you manage your time and creative energy?</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to act like it’s super engaging but of course there are times and seasons. Realistically if I’m being honest there are seasons that it’s just two weeks of you been at home and taking time by yourself and I utilise those times. And when the time for work comes you have to be on go as we are in a line of work where you really have to work as there are no royalties or pension plans. Now that the body is able to move is the time to move it and try prepare the ground for the future we are hoping for. It can be stressful sometimes but then I have a good balance of play time and work time.</p>



<p>What are some pivotal moments or lessons that have shaped your perspective on success and longevity in the entertainment industry?</p>



<p>A lot of people are trying to work smart and project into the future and make the best decisions but based on how I was brought up by the principles my parents instilled in me and watching them in their own lives simply centers on work hard and the next door would open. Whatever God has given you to do, do it well and your work would open new doors for you which would be the next level. So don’t focus too much on figuring out the next level and neglect what you have now. So pretty much that’s the principle I have applied to all I have doing and I have seen it work for me. When I was on Big Brother I was one of the most competitive guys and I did my best on the game show. The humility has always been there and I was ready to get my hand dirty to get the work done.</p>



<p><strong>What projects or roles do you aspire to take on in the future in Nollywood?</strong></p>



<p>I have done numerous projects and if you check my filmography as I would call it there are some projects I have done that is not out yet. Coincidentally most of the successful projects I have been on happen to be the action ones but I have some projects I have done that is not out yet which people would still enjoy. But do I enjoy action movies? Yes. I’m happy to hold that strong so like when you see an action movie and see that Tobi is in it you would know definitely you have to watch it. And what I love is that in all the action role I have played in there you can see love, drama and other things. But in terms of what I hope to do the Nigerian creative space is getting so creative now with more amazing writers, private investors, getting budgets and having leverage to create has platforms are engaging us and licensing our films so the best is yet to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What motivates and inspires you in your professional and personal life?</strong></p>



<p>I find joy and fulfillment in hardwork and that’s just me. So everything that I do I give my best and there is this sense of fulfillment I normally get off it. So it’s not a matter of what happens to it after but that I came here and I did my best is what matters. So whenever I get the opportunity to work, and do good work, I’m always happy to go there and exert myself and then I have seen how these things can translate all those things you wish for. Having the world appreciate you as a person and appreciate the work you do is definitely a blessing.</p>



<p><strong>Are there specific values or principles that guide your decision-making in both your personal and professional life?</strong></p>



<p>First, be a good person and kind person. So for me personally, I’m to the extent that everybody around me will agree, I’m just a jolly good fellow. So I like to live life simply, I have never done harm to anybody. I have never wish harm or bad on anybody. I have come to a time where I understand my own principles and understand my geology of life. So what I try to do is leave the exemplary life so the younger guys growing up can be like Tobi is successful but I totally didn’t do some of these things some of these other people did.</p>



<p><strong>Lastly, what is your plan for 2024?</strong></p>



<p>I’m looking to learn more, just be beyond being in front of the screen. So actively this year, I’m going to be learning a lot of what happens behind the screen. Because I genuinely love the 360 process of making films, TV shows and all of the things in production. I don’t want to limit myself to just being in front of the screen so now this is a year for me to learn the other parts and see how I can create more of an identity which I’m not in any rush for. But in the interim there are more film projects I have done that would be out, some I’m going to do and a lot more.</p>

Since then, he has worked in various areas of the entertainment industry and making waves as an actor with several blockbuster productions. In an exclusive interview with\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eTosin Clegg,\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Tobi delves into his journey to fame, his numerous award wins, strategies for staying relevant in the industry, and much more\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eH\u003cstrong\u003eow does the Berlinale Talents selection impact your career, and what are you looking forward to the most in this talent development program?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that I was chosen was a win for me. It was actually Lala, my first and only acting coach that asked me to apply and I gave it a trial. I love things that would open your mind and you can only open your mind when you are exposed. So I yearned for the exposure and decided to apply as you had to submit some of the projects you have done. So it’s a good one and a platform to showcase Nigeria again to the world because we are now being globally accepted in terms of our creativity. For me it’s just to go there, network and let them see what we do over here and learn how they do things so we can find a way to partner. And I feel that’s the ultimate win for everybody, collaborations. It’s a global village now and the kind of stories we can tell would be richer and relatable globally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you share some key experiences or challenges you faced during your transformation as an actor and how has it shaped your approach to the industry?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor me acting was never in my script after Big Brother and of course I used to love Nigerian movies growing up. I knew I wanted to go for Big Brother but afterwards I was just opened to anything that comes as I work hard. When I started acting I just fell in love with the whole process because I see what happens when they send you the scripts, I see what happens when we are reading and the whole manual process. The camera angles, the different takes, the edit, the colour, effects and all of those things then you see the end product and actually get to watch the audience enjoy the creativity. The first few times were challenging I won’t lie as immediately I was thrown into hot soup as I was acting with the likes of Maurice Sam, Sola Sobowale and a few others. You are a newbie but you have to pick up fast and I had to watch them closely to try and deliver. Gradually I got more comfortable and after doing that I got unto other projects that gave me the leverage that this is achievable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you choose roles, and what aspects of a script or character appeal to you the most when deciding to take on a project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen at the time and in all honesty it was more of the opportunities. When I started off it was wherever and whoever was ready to give me an opportunity I was ready to go there and show that I can do this has there is talent, I’m hardworking and I can perform. But now it has translated and it came from the fact that some people took a chance on me \u0026#8211; Jade Osiberu, Lala, Kunle Afolayan \u0026#8211; and this was an opportunity for me to learn and for me to show again what I could do. For all the scripts I have done that eventually comes out and have people appreciative of the arts there is a way it makes you feel. For me it’s the scripts before we get to the numbers, availability and I think to myself is this interesting to read, is this pushing the boundaries and I like talking to the writers too when I get the opportunities so I can understand their own creative process. So really, when you read a good script, you will know it’s a good script as there is no two ways about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWinning multiple awards in 2023, how does these accolades influence your goals and aspirations in the entertainment industry?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell I was never in it for the accolades. Genuinely my joy is putting out good work or being part of a project, I can comfortably sit and watch over and over again. You know, I’m a bit selfish, I don’t like to subject arts to the opinions of other people. Because you know it is perspective, what I think is nice, might not be nice to the other person. So for me I am a critic by nature, if I can sit down and enjoy something by watching over and over then it’s fulfillment. I just wanted to come and do good work with people already doing good work. Most of the projects I have been on I have been blessed with the best directors, best production company as everybody is putting great work. And you know you can’t drop the ball so I also come with my own specified input and we are able to make magic. But when the projects are publicly accepted and the accolades are coming I won’t lie it also feels good which is like justification of one’s work. It’s good and feels good to be recognised as it encourages you and it’s a pat on your back to know you are heading on the right direction. I don’t feel I have gotten to my apex where I feel I have done my best as this is still the early stages and the best is yet to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;How do you manage your time and creative energy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to act like it’s super engaging but of course there are times and seasons. Realistically if I’m being honest there are seasons that it’s just two weeks of you been at home and taking time by yourself and I utilise those times. And when the time for work comes you have to be on go as we are in a line of work where you really have to work as there are no royalties or pension plans. Now that the body is able to move is the time to move it and try prepare the ground for the future we are hoping for. It can be stressful sometimes but then I have a good balance of play time and work time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are some pivotal moments or lessons that have shaped your perspective on success and longevity in the entertainment industry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people are trying to work smart and project into the future and make the best decisions but based on how I was brought up by the principles my parents instilled in me and watching them in their own lives simply centers on work hard and the next door would open. Whatever God has given you to do, do it well and your work would open new doors for you which would be the next level. So don’t focus too much on figuring out the next level and neglect what you have now. So pretty much that’s the principle I have applied to all I have doing and I have seen it work for me. When I was on Big Brother I was one of the most competitive guys and I did my best on the game show. The humility has always been there and I was ready to get my hand dirty to get the work done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat projects or roles do you aspire to take on in the future in Nollywood?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have done numerous projects and if you check my filmography as I would call it there are some projects I have done that is not out yet. Coincidentally most of the successful projects I have been on happen to be the action ones but I have some projects I have done that is not out yet which people would still enjoy. But do I enjoy action movies? Yes. I’m happy to hold that strong so like when you see an action movie and see that Tobi is in it you would know definitely you have to watch it. And what I love is that in all the action role I have played in there you can see love, drama and other things. But in terms of what I hope to do the Nigerian creative space is getting so creative now with more amazing writers, private investors, getting budgets and having leverage to create has platforms are engaging us and licensing our films so the best is yet to come.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat motivates and inspires you in your professional and personal life?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI find joy and fulfillment in hardwork and that’s just me. So everything that I do I give my best and there is this sense of fulfillment I normally get off it. So it’s not a matter of what happens to it after but that I came here and I did my best is what matters. So whenever I get the opportunity to work, and do good work, I’m always happy to go there and exert myself and then I have seen how these things can translate all those things you wish for. Having the world appreciate you as a person and appreciate the work you do is definitely a blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there specific values or principles that guide your decision-making in both your personal and professional life?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, be a good person and kind person. So for me personally, I’m to the extent that everybody around me will agree, I’m just a jolly good fellow. So I like to live life simply, I have never done harm to anybody. I have never wish harm or bad on anybody. I have come to a time where I understand my own principles and understand my geology of life. So what I try to do is leave the exemplary life so the younger guys growing up can be like Tobi is successful but I totally didn’t do some of these things some of these other people did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLastly, what is your plan for 2024?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m looking to learn more, just be beyond being in front of the screen. So actively this year, I’m going to be learning a lot of what happens behind the screen. Because I genuinely love the 360 process of making films, TV shows and all of the things in production. I don’t want to limit myself to just being in front of the screen so now this is a year for me to learn the other parts and see how I can create more of an identity which I’m not in any rush for. But in the interim there are more film projects I have done that would be out, some I’m going to do and a lot more.\u003c/p\u003e\n","categoryId":7582,"thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Pix-17a-29.jpg","url":"/index.php/2024/02/10/tobi-bakre-nigerians-creativity-now-being-recognised-globally","tags":[]},"categoryName":"Life
