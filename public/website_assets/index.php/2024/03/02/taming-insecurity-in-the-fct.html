<p>Folalumi Alaran, in this report examines the current state of insecurity in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), its impact on nightlife and measures by security agencies to stem the tide</p>



<p>As the sun sets over Abuja, casting long shadows across the city’s streets, a darker narrative unfolds, one that strikes fear into the hearts of its residents – the resurgence of ‘one-chance’ robbery. In the heart of Nigeria’s capital, where the Aso Rock once symbolised safety.</p>



<p>A growing wave of insecurity has tainted the once serene, safe and peaceful atmosphere that defined the FCT in the past, striking fears into the hearts of its residents.</p>



<p>Merchants of evil who hawk a medley of malevolent items have assaulted its serenity and turned the once peaceful city into a nightmare</p>



<p>Virtually on daily basis are statistics and headlines and narratives that underscore the grim reality faced by those who have fallen victim to this growing urban menace.</p>



<p>Of the many security problems confronting the nation’s capital and its residents, the ‘one-chance’ menace and abductions for ransom loom large.</p>



<p>In the latter, no place is safe. People are kidnapped on the road, business places, farms and in the comfort of their homes</p>



<p>While many victims have lost their lives, even after their loved ones had struggled to pay ransom, some are still in captivity.</p>



<p>Several victims of ‘one-chance’ have also shared their harrowing experiences, revealing that falling prey to one-chance is not solely about carelessness.</p>



<p>The ordeal of a young man named Kolawole AbdulMajeed underscores the dire situation the hands of these marauding anti-social elements:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I was working late and I left the office around 8pm in the night. This happened around Area 11 in Abuja and the men in the taxi would never come across to you as criminals. They were four in number and in their early 50s. As I stopped the car and was getting in, the man in front started screaming the moment I shut the door.</p>



<p>“He complained that I had used the car door to hit his hands, while he was sitting in front. How could I have hit the back door with his hands in front?”</p>



<p>Little did AbdulMajeed know that while they were tying to distract him with the door drama, they had taken his phone and wallet from his bag. When they were done with what they wanted to do, they asked him to go down.</p>



<p>His experience echoes through the suburbs, where the ‘one-chance’ cases have found a renewed foothold, leaving residents on edge.</p>



<p>The criminals have mastered their craft, operating as syndicates that lay traps for unsuspecting passengers.</p>



<p>As the city grapples with a resurgence of such incidents, FCT Police Force Public Relations Officer (PRO), Deputy Superintendent of Police Josephine Adeh, in response to THISDAY’s enquiry, spoke&nbsp; about how the recent cases of insecurity, particularly the “One Chance” syndrome, impacted the safety of residents and visitors in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p>



<p>According to Adeh, there has been a drastic decrease, rather than an increase in insecurity, particularly&nbsp; “one chance”&nbsp; robbery. She stated that the immediate past FCT Commissioner of Police (CP) ensured the decrease in insecurity, a feat she argued that since assumption of office, the new CP Benneth Igweh has consolidated on.</p>



<p>For Adeh, the FCT is relatively calm now.</p>



<p>But many would wonder aloud: “have we not always heard this?” Yet, to many residents, the rate of kidnapping has continued to spike.</p>



<p>On the specific measures being taken to address the rising concerns about kidnapping within the FCT, the IGP recently launched the Special Intervention Squad (SIS), headed by the present Commissioner of Police, CP Benneth Igweh to address security challenges, particularly kidnapping.</p>



<p>The creation of the SIS seems to have yielded positive results, as several kidnappers’ camps were busted, kidnappers arrested, victims rescued and reunited with their families and loved ones.</p>



<p>Igweh has rolled out a new security approach to ensure the safety of those who engage in social activities during the evening hours. The presence of highly professional police operatives would be felt in such places to boost the confidence of individuals engaging in social activities at night, Adeh said.</p>



<p>However, in the suburbs, the situation is worsening. One of the suburbs that have witnessed a spate of criminal activities in recent weeks is Kurudu, one of the border communities with Nasarawa State.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of a Divisional Police Headquarters, criminal gangs, which were reportedly dislodged from some communities in Nasarawa State have found a safe haven in Kurudu.</p>



<p>Homes of many residents were said to have been broken into during the night and robbed by heavily armed criminals.</p>



<p>According to reports, there are several joints where criminals feast on banned substances and hard drugs around Kurudu, which aid their activities While the FCT, the once safest place in Nigeria, now battles an influx of criminals, including terrorists and bandits, exploiting the city’s vulnerabilities, the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike has pledged to combat insecurity.</p>



<p>Despite that pledge, the reality of ‘one-chance’ cases and other security challenges persist, leaving residents in fear.</p>



<p>The Secretary of the Command and Control Centre at the FCTA, Dr. Peter Olumuji, provides insights into the challenges posed by these crimes and the measures taken to address them.</p>



<p>In an interview, he sheds light on the security landscape, the balance between safety and nightlife, and the specific areas in the FCT that demand heightened vigilance.</p>



<p>He revealed the complexities of the security challenges and the impact on the city’s vibrant nightlife.</p>



<p>“Naturally, we have challenges of ‘one chance’ and kidnappings,” he admitted, adding however that security agencies have intensified their efforts, effecting numerous arrests and significantly reducing these crimes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The suspects, he claimed, “are either fleeing the FCT or aiding in the identification of their accomplices.”</p>



<p>Addressing concerns about nightlife, Olumuji dispelled the assumption that people are avoiding public spaces.</p>



<p>He asserts, “We go out many times to those places to look at these places that people go to for fun during the weekend, and we realised that there is no reduction at all in the level of people who go out in the FCT to clubs.” Despite increased security consciousness, fun-seekers continue to embrace the nightlife, he summed up.</p>



<p>The security chief delved into the delicate balance between maintaining a secure environment and allowing for a vibrant nightlife. He argued that security agencies cannot restrict nightlife, emphasising the importance of maintaining a robust economy fueled by social activities.</p>



<p>According to him, there has been no official announcements restricting movement in the night, adding that residents are free to move at any hour for any legitimate activity.</p>



<p>On specific areas of concern, Olumuji pointed to flashpoint areas around the FCT – Bwari Area Council, Kuje, and Kwali. However, he assured that strategic security measures were being implemented in these communities, with a focus on collaboration with the traditional institutions.</p>



<p>Empowering the natural leaders popularly known as traditional leaders and fostering a strong reporting template through call centres and emergency lines have contributed to a decline in crime rates in these areas, Olumuji said.</p>



<p>He acknowledged the impact of ‘one-chance’ crimes on public transportation, revealing measures the FCT administration is putting in place.</p>



<p>These include providing mass transit vehicles, ensuring registered and painted cabs, and increasing awareness among residents about personal safety in public transportation.</p>



<p>As Abuja grapples with the menace of insecurity, Olumuji’s insights provide a glimpse into the ongoing efforts to strike a delicate balance between security and maintaining the vibrancy of the city’s social life.</p>



<p>The challenge remains, but with strategic measures and community collaboration, Abuja aims to reclaim its status as a safe haven for both residents and those seeking the thrill of social&#8211; day or night.</p>



<p>The key to curbing ‘one-chance threats lies in overhauling Abuja’s disorganised urban transit system. The absence of structured transportation infrastructure and the prevalence of unmarked cabs contribute to the criminals’ ability to operate with impunity.</p>



<p>The residents of the FCT are raising their voices, demanding more decisive action from the government to address the growing menace.</p>



<p>The Director of Security Services Department at the Office of the Minister FCTA, Adamu B. Gwary, sheds light on the comprehensive measures initiated by the FCT administration. However, residents are questioning the effectiveness of these efforts, pushing for more concrete steps to ensure their safety.</p>



<p>“It is not only to the FCT per se; it is a national issue,” Gwary said, underscoring the widespread nature of the security challenge. Yet, the discontent among residents is palpable, with many expressing frustration over the perceived inadequacy of the current strategies.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The town hall meetings and public sensitisation campaigns, while commendable, are being criticised as insufficient in the face of the rising threat.</p>



<p>Residents, now more than ever, demand transparency and accountability from the government in addressing the foreseen challenges of recent abductions and kidnappings.</p>



<p>The call for enhanced collaboration between the community and security agencies is met with skepticism, as some residents question whether their concerns are genuinely being taken into account.</p>



<p>“We need more than just sensitisation; we need tangible action,” asserts a frustrated resident, reflecting the sentiments of many who feel that the government’s response falls short of their expectations. The emphasis on “See Something, Say Something” is met with skepticism, with residents questioning whether their reports are genuinely making a difference or merely disappearing into bureaucratic processes.</p>



<p>The controversy deepens as the discussion turns to self-defense. Some residents, feeling abandoned by the current security measures, are contemplating acquiring weapons for their protection. This provocative move highlights the trust deficit between the government and the people, with individuals expressing a lack of faith in the authorities’ ability to provide adequate security.</p>

In the heart of Nigeria’s capital, where the Aso Rock once symbolised safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA growing wave of insecurity has tainted the once serene, safe and peaceful atmosphere that defined the FCT in the past, striking fears into the hearts of its residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMerchants of evil who hawk a medley of malevolent items have assaulted its serenity and turned the once peaceful city into a nightmare\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVirtually on daily basis are statistics and headlines and narratives that underscore the grim reality faced by those who have fallen victim to this growing urban menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf the many security problems confronting the nation’s capital and its residents, the ‘one-chance’ menace and abductions for ransom loom large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the latter, no place is safe. People are kidnapped on the road, business places, farms and in the comfort of their homes\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many victims have lost their lives, even after their loved ones had struggled to pay ransom, some are still in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral victims of ‘one-chance’ have also shared their harrowing experiences, revealing that falling prey to one-chance is not solely about carelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ordeal of a young man named Kolawole AbdulMajeed underscores the dire situation the hands of these marauding anti-social elements:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “I was working late and I left the office around 8pm in the night. This happened around Area 11 in Abuja and the men in the taxi would never come across to you as criminals. They were four in number and in their early 50s. As I stopped the car and was getting in, the man in front started screaming the moment I shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“He complained that I had used the car door to hit his hands, while he was sitting in front. How could I have hit the back door with his hands in front?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did AbdulMajeed know that while they were tying to distract him with the door drama, they had taken his phone and wallet from his bag. When they were done with what they wanted to do, they asked him to go down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis experience echoes through the suburbs, where the ‘one-chance’ cases have found a renewed foothold, leaving residents on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe criminals have mastered their craft, operating as syndicates that lay traps for unsuspecting passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the city grapples with a resurgence of such incidents, FCT Police Force Public Relations Officer (PRO), Deputy Superintendent of Police Josephine Adeh, in response to THISDAY’s enquiry, spoke\u0026nbsp; about how the recent cases of insecurity, particularly the “One Chance” syndrome, impacted the safety of residents and visitors in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Adeh, there has been a drastic decrease, rather than an increase in insecurity, particularly\u0026nbsp; “one chance”\u0026nbsp; robbery. She stated that the immediate past FCT Commissioner of Police (CP) ensured the decrease in insecurity, a feat she argued that since assumption of office, the new CP Benneth Igweh has consolidated on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor Adeh, the FCT is relatively calm now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut many would wonder aloud: “have we not always heard this?” Yet, to many residents, the rate of kidnapping has continued to spike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the specific measures being taken to address the rising concerns about kidnapping within the FCT, the IGP recently launched the Special Intervention Squad (SIS), headed by the present Commissioner of Police, CP Benneth Igweh to address security challenges, particularly kidnapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe creation of the SIS seems to have yielded positive results, as several kidnappers’ camps were busted, kidnappers arrested, victims rescued and reunited with their families and loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIgweh has rolled out a new security approach to ensure the safety of those who engage in social activities during the evening hours. The presence of highly professional police operatives would be felt in such places to boost the confidence of individuals engaging in social activities at night, Adeh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in the suburbs, the situation is worsening. One of the suburbs that have witnessed a spate of criminal activities in recent weeks is Kurudu, one of the border communities with Nasarawa State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the presence of a Divisional Police Headquarters, criminal gangs, which were reportedly dislodged from some communities in Nasarawa State have found a safe haven in Kurudu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomes of many residents were said to have been broken into during the night and robbed by heavily armed criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to reports, there are several joints where criminals feast on banned substances and hard drugs around Kurudu, which aid their activities While the FCT, the once safest place in Nigeria, now battles an influx of criminals, including terrorists and bandits, exploiting the city’s vulnerabilities, the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike has pledged to combat insecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite that pledge, the reality of ‘one-chance’ cases and other security challenges persist, leaving residents in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of the Command and Control Centre at the FCTA, Dr. Peter Olumuji, provides insights into the challenges posed by these crimes and the measures taken to address them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn an interview, he sheds light on the security landscape, the balance between safety and nightlife, and the specific areas in the FCT that demand heightened vigilance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe revealed the complexities of the security challenges and the impact on the city’s vibrant nightlife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Naturally, we have challenges of ‘one chance’ and kidnappings,” he admitted, adding however that security agencies have intensified their efforts, effecting numerous arrests and significantly reducing these crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The suspects, he claimed, “are either fleeing the FCT or aiding in the identification of their accomplices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAddressing concerns about nightlife, Olumuji dispelled the assumption that people are avoiding public spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe asserts, “We go out many times to those places to look at these places that people go to for fun during the weekend, and we realised that there is no reduction at all in the level of people who go out in the FCT to clubs.” Despite increased security consciousness, fun-seekers continue to embrace the nightlife, he summed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe security chief delved into the delicate balance between maintaining a secure environment and allowing for a vibrant nightlife. He argued that security agencies cannot restrict nightlife, emphasising the importance of maintaining a robust economy fueled by social activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to him, there has been no official announcements restricting movement in the night, adding that residents are free to move at any hour for any legitimate activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn specific areas of concern, Olumuji pointed to flashpoint areas around the FCT – Bwari Area Council, Kuje, and Kwali. However, he assured that strategic security measures were being implemented in these communities, with a focus on collaboration with the traditional institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmpowering the natural leaders popularly known as traditional leaders and fostering a strong reporting template through call centres and emergency lines have contributed to a decline in crime rates in these areas, Olumuji said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe acknowledged the impact of ‘one-chance’ crimes on public transportation, revealing measures the FCT administration is putting in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese include providing mass transit vehicles, ensuring registered and painted cabs, and increasing awareness among residents about personal safety in public transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Abuja grapples with the menace of insecurity, Olumuji’s insights provide a glimpse into the ongoing efforts to strike a delicate balance between security and maintaining the vibrancy of the city’s social life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenge remains, but with strategic measures and community collaboration, Abuja aims to reclaim its status as a safe haven for both residents and those seeking the thrill of social\u0026#8211; day or night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to curbing ‘one-chance threats lies in overhauling Abuja’s disorganised urban transit system. The absence of structured transportation infrastructure and the prevalence of unmarked cabs contribute to the criminals’ ability to operate with impunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe residents of the FCT are raising their voices, demanding more decisive action from the government to address the growing menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director of Security Services Department at the Office of the Minister FCTA, Adamu B. Gwary, sheds light on the comprehensive measures initiated by the FCT administration. However, residents are questioning the effectiveness of these efforts, pushing for more concrete steps to ensure their safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not only to the FCT per se; it is a national issue,” Gwary said, underscoring the widespread nature of the security challenge. Yet, the discontent among residents is palpable, with many expressing frustration over the perceived inadequacy of the current strategies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The town hall meetings and public sensitisation campaigns, while commendable, are being criticised as insufficient in the face of the rising threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResidents, now more than ever, demand transparency and accountability from the government in addressing the foreseen challenges of recent abductions and kidnappings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe call for enhanced collaboration between the community and security agencies is met with skepticism, as some residents question whether their concerns are genuinely being taken into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We need more than just sensitisation; we need tangible action,” asserts a frustrated resident, reflecting the sentiments of many who feel that the government’s response falls short of their expectations. The emphasis on “See Something, Say Something” is met with skepticism, with residents questioning whether their reports are genuinely making a difference or merely disappearing into bureaucratic processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe controversy deepens as the discussion turns to self-defense. Some residents, feeling abandoned by the current security measures, are contemplating acquiring weapons for their protection. This provocative move highlights the trust deficit between the government and the people, with individuals expressing a lack of faith in the authorities’ ability to provide adequate security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, Gwary rejects the idea of residents arming themselves, sparking a heated debate. Residents argue that if the government cannot ensure their safety, they should have the right to take matters into their own hands.
