<p><strong>*DHQ confirms support from foreign nations </strong></p>



<p><strong>*First lady seeks stiffer penalty for kidnappers </strong></p>



<p><strong>*Bandits demand $620,000 to release hostages</strong></p>



<p>Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh, Michael Olugbode and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja</p>



<p>The National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, Service Chiefs led by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Christopher Musa, and some governors from the Northern states, last night, held a closed-door meeting to discuss the rising insecurity in the country.<br>Although the agenda of the meeting was not officially disclosed, it was reliably gathered that the discussion centred on strategic plans on how to rescue the internally displaced persons, schoolchildren and Tsangaya students recently abducted by terrorists in Borno, Kaduna and Sokoto states respectively.<br>But the Defence Headquarters, yesterday, confirmed that security forces were receiving foreign support and intelligence in the ongoing efforts to rescue hundreds of abducted school children in Kaduna.</p>



<p><br>This was as the First Lady, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, has called for stiffer penalties for kidnappers in the country, coming 24 hours after President Bola Tinubu foreclosed the possibility of paying ransom to kidnappers before securing freedom for victims.<br>At the same time, gunmen, who kidnapped 286 students and staff from a school, last week, have demanded a total of 1 billion naira ($620,432) for their release, a spokesman for the families of the hostages and a local councillor, told Reuters.</p>



<p><br>Yet, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Dr. Ahmed Audi, has said efforts were in top gear to get the Kaduna abducted students released, insisting that with the collaborative efforts of all security agencies, there would be speedy recovery of the students.<br>Nevertheless, Minister of the FCT, Nyesom Wike, has disclosed that the FCT administration was considering the idea of purchasing some drones to monitor kidnappers and bandits operating from the states bordering the FCT.<br>However, the meeting by the nation’s security heads, which started at about 1:30pm came on the heels of a marching order by President Bola Tinubu to the security forces to rescue the children unhurt and without paying a dime as ransom.<br>The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, had conveyed the president’s message on Wednesday that the federal government would not pay any money as ransom to the terrorists, who had earlier demanded N40trn.</p>



<p><br>Speaking after the meeting, which ended at about 6pm, Chairman of the Northern Governors’ Forum, Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, said the meeting was convened to discuss and review strategies towards tackling cases of insecurity in the North.<br>&#8220;The essence of the meeting as you can see is between the governors and the service chiefs and the National Security Adviser.<br>&#8220;So, it relates to security and you know security is very typical, especially that there were the recent issues of kidnapping in the North-West and we are becoming so concerned that we need to discuss, review and possibly take alternative options to what we have been doing before so that we can have a better result,&#8221; he said.<br>The governor added that the need for a collaborative approach to tackling insecurity in the region necessitated the meeting, stressing the need for non-kinetic and kinetic approaches to address the remote causes of insecurity.<br>Yahaya noted that the security agencies were doing their best, but there was the need for non-kinetic approach to address the root causes of the problem.<br>&#8220;In fact, that&#8217;s the best way to go because the issue is until we join the two (approaches) and already the service chiefs and all other security agencies have been doing their best.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;So what we need to do is to change style, especially in addition with the non-kinetic approach, so that at the end of it when we join the two, we&#8217;ll have a better security situation in the country,&#8221; he said.<br>A highly-placed official within the security agencies confided in THISDAY that the meeting had Governors Uba Sani (Kaduna), Dauda Lawal (Zamfara), Babagana Zulum (Borno), Radda Dikko (Katsina), and Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), among others in attendance.<br>THISDAY had reported how terrorists abducted 287 students from a primary and secondary school in Kuriga, Kaduna State on March 7, while 112 IDPs in Gamboru Ngala, Borno, were also abducted by terrorists.<br> The abduction of 15 Quranic school students in Sokoto State followed the Kuriga incident, a development several bodies had condemned.<br><br><strong>DHQ: Security Forces Receiving Foreign Support, Intelligence in Operation to Rescue</strong></p>



<p>Defence Headquarters DHQ), yesterday, said security forces were receiving foreign support and intelligence in the ongoing efforts to rescue hundreds of abducted school children in Kaduna.<br>It said security agencies would not rest until the kidnap victims were returned even as it attributed the delay in response time to the absence of timely information to the troops.<br>Speaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Edward Buba, said security forces received intelligence support from international partners.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;Given the hostage situation, it can be deduced that the search and rescue effort was grossly affected by the none timely notification of troops of the incident. Nevertheless, I can assure you that we will not rest until these hostages  are returned,&#8221; he said.<br>He declared that troops would ensure that the kidnap victims were returned as their rescue remained top priority.<br>&#8220;I can further assure that getting these hostages back is very clearly on the top of our priorities. It is for this reason we have leveraged on our international partners for support.<br>&#8220;Accordingly, they are providing the necessary support including intelligence that is giving us the  advantage in dealing with the ugly situation,&#8221; he said.<br>Buba attributed the resort to mass kidnapping by terrorists as a result of the onslaught by troops, which forced the insurgents to attack soft targets.<br>&#8220;We made things difficult for them so they have gone for soft targets as part of  their recruitment drive<br>&#8220;We will not rest until all of those hostages are returned. We have intelligence and support from our foreign partners but because it&#8217;s an ongoing operation we will not provide further details,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><br>Buba further noted that, &#8220;terrorists have exhibited gross cowardice. We have taken out many of their commanders. They switch into soft targets to protect themselves. We will not rest until all these hostages return.&#8221;<br>He also disclosed that the hostages were held in difficult locations.<br>&#8220;These hostages are being held in locations that are difficult to get to, but not out of reached. The situation is however indicative of the desperation of these terrorist to avoid troops onslaught by all means.<br>&#8220;Recall that in recent times troops have decimated several of the terrorist leaders, commander and foot soldiers. We are fast closing in one several others.<br>&#8220;These terrorist have exhibited cowardice by going for such soft targets to impede troops advances. I assure you that we will not rest until they are returned,&#8221; he assured.</p>



<p><strong>Remi Tinubu Seeks Stiffer Penalty for Kidnappers</strong></p>



<p>The First Lady, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, has reiterated her call for stiffer penalties for kidnappers in the country.<br>Speaking yesterday while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Senators representing the three senatorial districts of Lagos State, the first lady appealed to the federal lawmakers to enact security-related laws to stem the tide of kidnapping across the country.<br>“We should look into the laws we would bring up. On the issue of kidnapping, it is like we are in a war, a war against kidnapping and kidnappers.”  <br>Mrs Tinubu, who also admonished Nigerians to help one another, said, “The administration of President Tinubu is resolute to leave a legacy for generations yet unborn. This takes a lot of sacrifice and courage.”</p>



<p><br>Earlier, leader of delegation and Senator representing Lagos East and Chairman, Southern Senators Forum, Adetokunbo Abiru, noted that the reforms of President Tinubu were on course to putting the nation on a solid footing of economic wellbeing and lasting prosperity.<br>He also assured the first lady that the senate would continue to look into people-centered legislation, especially in relation to the economy and security.<br>Abiru expressed optimism that the nation would soon be an economic haven.<br>Others on the visit were Senator representing Lagos Central, Wasiu Eshinlokun Sanni, who is also Chairman, Senate Committee on Marine Transport and Senator representing Lagos West, Oluranti Adebule, Chairman Senate Committee on Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation.</p>



<p><strong>Bandits Demand $620,000 to Release Hostages</strong></p>



<p>Gunmen, who kidnapped 286 students and staff from a school in northern Nigeria last week have demanded a total of N1 billion ($620,432) for their release, a spokesman for the families of the hostages and a local councillor, has told Reuters.<br>The school children, some older students and members of the school staff were  abducted on March 7 in the town of Kuriga, in Nigeria’s northwestern Kaduna State, in the first mass kidnapping in the country since 2021.<br>A community leader, Jubril Aminu, who acted as a spokesman for the families of the hostages, said he had received a call on his phone from the kidnappers on Tuesday.</p>



<p><br>“They made a total of a 1 billion (naira) ransom demand for all the pupils, students and staff of the school.<br>“They gave an ultimatum to pay the ransom within 20 days, effective from the date of the kidnap. They said they will kill all the students and the staff if the ransom demand is not met.”<br>An elected official from the Kuriga Ward municipal council, Idris Ibrahim, also confirmed the ransom demand and the amount.<br>“Yes, the kidnappers called the community through Jubril Aminu’s number and made the demand.<br>“They called from a hidden number but the authorities are working on getting the number,” Ibrahim told Reuters.</p>



<p><strong>NSCDC: Efforts in Top Gear to Free Abducted Kaduna Students</strong></p>



<p>Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Dr. Ahmed Audi, has said efforts are in top gear to get Kaduna abducted students released, insisting that with the collaborative efforts of all security agencies, there would be speedy recovery of the students.<br>The CG gave the assurance to the Kaduna State Governor, Senator Uba Sani, while on a visit to the state.</p>



<p>He said the 200 students and teachers of Government Secondary School and LEA Primary School in Kuriga Chikun LGA in Kaduna would be rescued from their abductors and brought home safely.<br>Audi condemned such act of sabotage describing it as very unfortunate and worrisome.<br>He assured the governor that efforts were in top gear as the security agencies were relentlessly working to effect the release of the students and their teachers.<br>“As a matter of concern, let me on behalf of the NSCDC management and personnel across the nation say that we are ready to work in collaboration with all relevant security agencies with full mechanisms and security apparatus put in place to see that the perpetrators of this heinous crime do not go scot free.<br>&#8220;The NSCDC remains a key actor in the nation&#8217;s internal security and the lead agency in the Safe Schools Initiative,currently we are in strong synergy with the Nigerian Army, the Police and others for the quick and safe return of the abducted students,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><br>The NSCDC boss commended the governor for providing the necessary logistics for the state command to function effectively while also praying for the allocation of a befitting command permanent site and operational vehicles that would enhance the discharge of the corps&#8217; statutory mandate in safeguarding all critical national assets and infrastructure across the state.<br>Sani, in his response, lauded the good gesture exhibited by the CG and the effective collaboration of the corps with the Armed Forces, Nigeria Police, and the DSS amongst others.<br>He hinted that all critical stakeholders must play active roles to forestall criminalities and frustrate the evil men whose delight is to disrupt the peace and stability of the good people of Kaduna state.</p>



<p><strong>Wike: FCTA to Acquire Drones to Survey Kidnappers, Bandits</strong></p>



<p>The FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike, has disclosed that the FCT Administration was considering purchasing some drones to monitor kidnappers and bandits operating from the states bordering the FCT.<br>He stated this yesterday during a media chat monitored on national television.<br>The minister said he had already secured the approval of President Bola Tinubu to acquire the drones for security purpose.<br>“In fact, that is one of the approvals Mr President gave to us that we said &#8216;look, we are going to purchase our own drones to help in surveillance and in operation, particularly within these boundaries that the topography is so bad, is so hilly, and where you have the forests&#8217;.</p>



<p><br>“And we have made sure that it is provided in the 2024 statutory budget. I briefed this to the National Assembly yesterday (Wednesday )and they were highly elated,” Wike said.<br>He decried the lack of tracking equipment for security agencies, particularly in FCT Commands of the Police and the Department of State Services.<br>Wike said the Police and DSS officers lacked tracking equipment and often had to visit the headquarters of their agencies to borrow the equipment for use in operations.</p>



<p><br>“It is unfortunate to say this, that mostly the security agencies, in particular I will say, the police here, are not adequately equipped. In fact, you cannot believe it that the Police Command of the FCT does not even have ordinary tracking device.<br>“You cannot believe that. Not only them, even the FCT Command of the Department of State Services does not even have. And the only one they have is at the headquarters.<br>“So, if there are things to do, they have to go to the headquarters, which is not supposed to be. Luckily, I told Mr President that &#8216;look, we have to do something, and there must be the emergency procurement of these equipment&#8217;,” he said.</p>



<p><br>Wike disclosed that the Bureau of Public Procurement had earlier rejected FCTA&#8217;s request for emergency procurement of equipment for the security agencies, until the president gave approval for the emergency procurement in January, following spate of kidnappings in the territory.</p>
