<p><strong>Again, Defence Chief Meets Ribadu, EFCC Chairman, Calls for End to Terror Financing</strong></p>



<p><strong>*Banditry: Sack non-performing security chiefs, APC chairmen advise Tinubu</strong></p>



<p><strong>*President: Beneficiaries of removed petrol subsidy sabotaging our reforms</strong><br><strong>*Optimistic govt will win battle against economic saboteurs</strong><br><strong>*Sets up committee of governors to uplift Nigerians headed by Shettima</strong></p>



<p>Deji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja</p>



<p>The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Christopher Musa, once more met with the National Security Adviser (NSA), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, yesterday, during which he stressed the need for tracking of terrorism funding in Nigeria, THISDAY learnt yesterday.<br>Also yesterday, in a separate meeting with the Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, in his office at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) in Abuja, Musa, noted that tracking terrorism funding was one of the non-kinetic approaches to the war against terrorism across the globe.<br>However, yesterday, speaking with newsmen after a meeting with President Bola Tinubu, the Forum of State Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) advised the President to wield the big stick against any security chief not living up to expectation in the fight against insecurity across the country.<br>Equally, during the meeting, Tinubu lamented that those that were benefiting from fuel subsidy that had been removed by his government were working against people-oriented policies being implemented by the current administration at the centre.</p>



<p><br>Ribadu had on Thursday, held a high-level security meeting with the 19 Northern Governors, Ministers of Defence, Police Affairs, and Interior, as well as the country’s security chiefs in Abuja, the nation’s capital.<br>The meeting was in continuation of efforts to combat the escalating security threats in the northern region.<br>However, Musa, during the meeting with the EFCC Chairman, spoke on the use of census, installation of CCTV cameras in strategic points to contain cases of corruption, terrorism and other forms of insecurity in the country.<br>According to him, the Armed Forces of Nigeria has zero tolerance for corrupt practices and as such adopts the proceedings of a General Court Martial (GCM) to checkmate culpable personnel.</p>



<p><br>General Musa urged the EFCC boss to encourage public office holders and other Nigerians in positions of authority to uphold good governance to forestall economic breakdown and insecurity.  <br>A statement issued by Defence Headquarters said the CDS further informed the Chairman of the anti-graft body that AFN synergises with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other stakeholders to fight oil theft in the country.<br>He lamented that the issues of blocking loopholes brought about by siphoning of oil and soft legal system which delays prosecution of suspects have been major challenges.<br>The CDS, who harped on the use of census, installation of CCTV cameras in strategic points to contain cases of corruption, terrorism and other forms of insecurity in the country, encouraged Olukoyede to keep up his good work and remain assured of the suppot and cooperation of the AFN.  <br>While congratulating him on his appointment as the EFCC boss, the CDS gave an assurance that the AFN will not derail from its commitment to ensure the survival democratic rule.<br>He commended the EFCC Chairman for his unique approach of leveraging on the potentials of technology to fight corruption and other forms of economic crimes.</p>



<p><br>Earlier in his remarks, the EFCC Chairman stated that he was at the Defence Headquarters to explore avenues of cooperation and collaboration in the ongoing fight against corruption in the country.<br>Olukoyede recalled that on assumption of office, he laid so much emphasis on the need for Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of collaboration, being the key to winning the war against corruption. He pointed out that the war against corruption must be won as the menace has destroyed the nation&#8217;s economy and at same time dented her good image.<br>He strongly warned that if drastic measures were not taken to nip it in the bud, the country would be in jeopardy in the next 10 years.<br>The EFCC boss noted that as a means to mitigate the menace caused by corruption and insecurity, he posited that cognitive responsibility should be embraced by the military and other security agencies, adding that the war against corruption should be seen as everbody&#8217;s business.</p>



<p><strong>Banditry: Sack Non-performing Security Chiefs, APC Chairmen Advise Tinubu</strong><br>Meanwhile, addressing newsmen on behalf of other Chairmen, Secretary of the Forum and Chairman of Cross River State chapter of APC, Alphonsus Oga Eba, said the issue of insecurity in the country was discussed during the meeting.<br>Responding to a question on recent kidnappings especially in Kaduna State, Eba said: &#8220;On the question of the kidnap of pupils in Kaduna State, yes it forms one of the issues about the general insecurity in the country that we raised as a matter of concern to Mr. President.<br>&#8220;We said we are more concerned because from our vintage position, it is very clear there are a lot of distractions going on in this country. There are activities of criminals that are being perpetrated to put the government and our party in bad light. We have commended Mr. President for the support, moral and financial that he has given to security agencies.</p>



<p><br>“But we came with one humble advice that we gave to Mr. President today as forum of chairmen to say that nobody expects Mr. President as Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to carry arms and go to the battlefield.<br> &#8220;That is why he has his lieutenants, as security agencies in various areas and what we have told Mr. President today, by way of advice, is that it is time for people to be held accountable for the actions.</p>



<p><br>“Where a district police officer or a commissioner of police or whoever that is in control of whatever security architecture at whatever level is found wanting, Mr. President should wield the big stick. That was part of what we discussed today.&#8221;<br>Asked whether the issue of the crisis in Edo State over the recently conducted gubernatorial primaries was discussed, Eba, said, &#8220;Edo State issue came up yesterday (Thursday) in our meeting. We discussed it extensively. We had reached some conclusions, but it was not one of the issues we discussed with Mr. President today because there are still internal party affairs that we are rising up from here now to continue a meeting with the national Chairman of our party and the NWC.”</p>



<p><br>Also responding to a question on government&#8217;s performance assessment, the APC Chairmen cautioned against premature judgment, noting that it&#8217;s too early to evaluate the administration&#8217;s effectiveness within nine months despite the party&#8217;s previous tenure in power over eight years ago<br>The chairmen commended the administration’s economic policies and assure Nigerians of meaningful reforms<br>Earlier speaking at the meeting, Tinubu lamented that those that were benefiting from fuel subsidy that had been removed by his government were working against people-oriented policies being implemented by the current administration at the centre.<br>He, however, assured Nigerians that he would overcome the sinister activities of the economic saboteurs through good governance and firm commitment to the citizenry.</p>



<p><br>The President said: &#8220;As we are fighting corruption, smugglers, and old subsidy beneficiaries, they most certainly will fight back. All those who falsified records and became losers with the subsidy (on petroleum products) removal, they will fight back. But we will defend our people.&#8221;<br>Tinubu, stressed that his administration was deploying resources to critical sectors and areas with significant impact on the welfare of Nigerians, emphasising that the nation&#8217;s treasury is sacrosanct and must not be abused.</p>



<p><br>He added: &#8220;The treasury belongs to the people, and that sacred trust must not be abused.&#8221;<br>The President assured Nigerians that his government was working around the clock to improve their living conditions, and asked leaders at the grassroots level to encourage citizens to get their National Identification Number (NIN) for planning, structuring interventions and to achieve their full integration into various relief programmes.<br>&#8220;I urge the state chairmen that regardless of party affiliation, let us help citizens by mobilising them for NIN registration. Not just PVCs. Some are poor Nigerians who have not experienced formal education and have no understanding of what NIN is and how it will benefit their lives. We must teach them. We must care for them.</p>



<p>“Without NIN, we cannot embark on social security interventions for the vulnerable. We will be making faulty moves without accurate data and iron-clad, digital intervention structures. I have established a committee of governors, and it is headed by the Vice President, Senator Kashim Shettima. It is working on what must be done to further lift our people.</p>



<p>“We need to give hope, and we are giving it to the country and our citizens. We are working hard, day and night, even though some agents of destabilisation are present in the polity. Nigerians, with our focused support, shall defeat them.</p>



<p>“The programme of our government will be truly progressive; student loans, a national consumer credit system, and social welfare for the unemployed, as well as graduates. Every Nigerian will find a place of belonging in our country. In the eye of even the biggest hurricane, we will find that place of tranquility and prosperous harmony for the benefit of all. Nigerians will all partake on this national journey to prosperity,’’ the President said.</p>



<p>Emphasising the central role of agriculture in expanding and accelerating Nigeria&#8217;s economic growth, President Tinubu told the state party chairmen, led by the APC National Chairman, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, that his government had already drawn up a blueprint for large-scale livestock farming, which will be activated soon.</p>



<p>Tinubu emphasised that the repositioning of the economy was a top national priority as he urged party members not to wait for an appointment before bringing good governance and exemplary civic engagement to the doors of Nigerians.</p>



<p>Earlier in his remarks, Ganduje, said the party was nearly set to establish the Progressive Institute of Policy and Development for the benefit of its members and the broader Nigerian public.</p>

He pointed out that the war against corruption must be won as the menace has destroyed the nation\u0026#8217;s economy and at same time dented her good image.\u003cbr\u003eHe strongly warned that if drastic measures were not taken to nip it in the bud, the country would be in jeopardy in the next 10 years.\u003cbr\u003eThe EFCC boss noted that as a means to mitigate the menace caused by corruption and insecurity, he posited that cognitive responsibility should be embraced by the military and other security agencies, adding that the war against corruption should be seen as everbody\u0026#8217;s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBanditry: Sack Non-performing Security Chiefs, APC Chairmen Advise Tinubu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, addressing newsmen on behalf of other Chairmen, Secretary of the Forum and Chairman of Cross River State chapter of APC, Alphonsus Oga Eba, said the issue of insecurity in the country was discussed during the meeting.\u003cbr\u003eResponding to a question on recent kidnappings especially in Kaduna State, Eba said: \u0026#8220;On the question of the kidnap of pupils in Kaduna State, yes it forms one of the issues about the general insecurity in the country that we raised as a matter of concern to Mr. President.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;We said we are more concerned because from our vintage position, it is very clear there are a lot of distractions going on in this country. There are activities of criminals that are being perpetrated to put the government and our party in bad light.

That was part of what we discussed today.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003eAsked whether the issue of the crisis in Edo State over the recently conducted gubernatorial primaries was discussed, Eba, said, \u0026#8220;Edo State issue came up yesterday (Thursday) in our meeting. We discussed it extensively. We had reached some conclusions, but it was not one of the issues we discussed with Mr. President today because there are still internal party affairs that we are rising up from here now to continue a meeting with the national Chairman of our party and the NWC.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso responding to a question on government\u0026#8217;s performance assessment, the APC Chairmen cautioned against premature judgment, noting that it\u0026#8217;s too early to evaluate the administration\u0026#8217;s effectiveness within nine months despite the party\u0026#8217;s previous tenure in power over eight years ago\u003cbr\u003eThe chairmen commended the administration’s economic policies and assure Nigerians of meaningful reforms\u003cbr\u003eEarlier speaking at the meeting, Tinubu lamented that those that were benefiting from fuel subsidy that had been removed by his government were working against people-oriented policies being implemented by the current administration at the centre.\u003cbr\u003eHe, however, assured Nigerians that he would overcome the sinister activities of the economic saboteurs through good governance and firm commitment to the citizenry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe President said: \u0026#8220;As we are fighting corruption, smugglers, and old subsidy beneficiaries, they most certainly will fight back. All those who falsified records and became losers with the subsidy (on petroleum products) removal, they will fight back. But we will defend our people.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003eTinubu, stressed that his administration was deploying resources to critical sectors and areas with significant impact on the welfare of Nigerians, emphasising that the nation\u0026#8217;s treasury is sacrosanct and must not be abused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe added: \u0026#8220;The treasury belongs to the people, and that sacred trust must not be abused.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003eThe President assured Nigerians that his government was working around the clock to improve their living conditions, and asked leaders at the grassroots level to encourage citizens to get their National Identification Number (NIN) for planning, structuring interventions and to achieve their full integration into various relief programmes.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;I urge the state chairmen that regardless of party affiliation, let us help citizens by mobilising them for NIN registration. Not just PVCs. Some are poor Nigerians who have not experienced formal education and have no understanding of what NIN is and how it will benefit their lives. We must teach them. We must care for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Without NIN, we cannot embark on social security interventions for the vulnerable. We will be making faulty moves without accurate data and iron-clad, digital intervention structures. I have established a committee of governors, and it is headed by the Vice President, Senator Kashim Shettima. It is working on what must be done to further lift our people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to give hope, and we are giving it to the country and our citizens. We are working hard, day and night, even though some agents of destabilisation are present in the polity. Nigerians, with our focused support, shall defeat them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The programme of our government will be truly progressive; student loans, a national consumer credit system, and social welfare for the unemployed, as well as graduates. Every Nigerian will find a place of belonging in our country. In the eye of even the biggest hurricane, we will find that place of tranquility and prosperous harmony for the benefit of all. Nigerians will all partake on this national journey to prosperity,’’ the President said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmphasising the central role of agriculture in expanding and accelerating
