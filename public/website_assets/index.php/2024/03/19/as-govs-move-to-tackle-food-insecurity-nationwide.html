<p><strong>Chuks Okocha</strong> writes on the spirited efforts being taken by the 36 state governors to address the recurring issue of food insecurity biting hard on the citizenry across the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Following a report by the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) Study which said about 31.5 million Nigerians may experience food and nutrition crisis between June and August 2024, Governors of all the 36 states of the federation under the auspices of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) have released  measures being taken to tackle the current food crisis and economic hardships facing Nigerians.</p>



<p>Cadre Hatmonisé is a food and nutrition insecurity study conducted by the federal ministry of agriculture and food security in collaboration with other partners including the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p>



<p>The report may have compelled the governors to roll out their efforts at controlling the food insecurity in the country.</p>



<p>The report released by the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) last Sunday signed by its acting head of media, Halimah Salihu Ahmed, said&nbsp; the governors have taken several proactive steps to counter the present food crisis as well as the inherent economic hardships.</p>



<p>According to the report, “In Akwa Ibom State, the government is planning to establish an agency which will buy food items in bulk and then sell them at cheaper prices to the residents.</p>



<p>“Towards this end, the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Umo Eno, has forwarded to the House of Assembly a bill for the establishment of the agency.”</p>



<p>The report quoted the governor as appealing to residents of Akwa Ibom State to be patient, while promising to sign the bill into law once it is passed by the assembly.</p>



<p>Eno said: “We will buy the food items in bulk and ensure that they are made available to our people at relatively lower prices. The process will be transparent. I want to thank the House of Assembly for the expeditious manner this Bill is being treated. I want to assure our people that we feel their pain and are working hard to ensure that food security for our people is guaranteed.”</p>



<p>In the same vein, in&nbsp; Kano State, the report also said government has raided warehouses where traders are suspected of hoarding food supplies.</p>



<p>The NGF report further stated: “In Yobe State, government banned bulk purchases of grain from local markets to stop hoarding and exports across Nigeria’s borders saying it was to “stem the tide of food scarcity and high cost of grains”.</p>



<p>“In Niger State, Governor Mohammed Bago announced a ban on the mass purchase of foodstuffs from local markets. He ordered security forces to confiscate trucks carrying products in bulk and “share the food to the people”.</p>



<p>“In Enugu State, Governor Peter Mbah said his administration will eradicate hunger and poverty in the state and unlock the rural economy through investment in agriculture and agro-industrialisation.</p>



<p>Mbah, who was represented by the secretary to the state government, Professor Chidiebere Onyia, said this during the celebration of the 2023 World Food Day in Enugu.</p>



<p>The governor said the state government was intensifying efforts to grow the economy of the state from $4.4 billion to $30 billion through massive investment in agriculture by attracting investors, empowering the farmers and opening the rural economy of the state.</p>



<p>As governors firmly respond to the multiple consequences of a food crisis, for the masses, it may just be morning yet on creation day, the report stated.</p>



<p>Also, the Ekiti&nbsp; State Government said it has earmarked N1 billion to improve food production, especially for land preparation, driven by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security’s tractorization subsidy scheme, and an input supply programme to support small scale farmers.</p>



<p>Similarly, the government said it is also committing a whopping sum of N1.2 billion it recently got as first tranche of the World Bank-financed Livestock Productivity and Resilience Support ( L-PRES) Project to transform the livestock subsector.</p>



<p>According to the NGF report, in Ekiti state,&nbsp; the fund would be spent on empowering livestock farmers, boosting livestock productivity as well as creating a conducive environment for youths and private sector involvement in livestock businesses.</p>



<p>This, the NGF report said,&nbsp; will include revamping all veterinary clinics across the local government areas and the state veterinary hospital; development of poultry sector across the value chain from production to processing; feed formulation and artificial insemination (Al) training and support, among others.</p>



<p>In Zamfara state, Governor Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State hosted the Swedish Ambassador, Annika Hahn-Englund, and discussed partnership on how to grow the state economy and address the current hardships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report said the meeting was held with a view to creating collaboration and partnership in critical areas of the economy, build long-term relationships, and implement transformative projects to benefit Zamfara State and its people.</p>



<p>It said: “At the meeting, Governor Lawal assured the Swedish Ambassador of his administration’s readiness to promote collaboration and sustainable development across various sectors.</p>



<p>“Sweden has expressed interest in partnering with Zamfara State to build long-term relationships and implement transformative projects for the state’s people in Nigeria.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, the envoy pledged to offer Zamfara technical expertise in responsible mining practices, modern agricultural techniques, renewable energy infrastructure, and support in improving education and healthcare services.</p>



<p>The report also stated that Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State, who is also Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, in collaboration with&nbsp; Governors Agbu Kefas of Taraba State; Lucky Aiyedatiwa of Ondo State; and Ahmed Ododo of Kogi State will interface with&nbsp; the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (FMAFS) and push for increased crop production to tackle food inflation and food shortages in Nigeria.</p>



<p>The report said Governor Abdulrazaq explained that the Anchor Borrowers Programme that was previously implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria did not achieve much.</p>



<p>He called on the Agriculture Minister to work hard to meet the food targets of government, as this was vital for the Nigerian masses, adding that state governors would work with the ministry.</p>



<p>According to NGF Chairman; “We could not achieve much with the CBN Anchor Borrowers programme; it was very challenging. The issue of food security is a one-stop-shop and we need to concentrate on what we are doing. We need to concentrate on what we are doing for the dry season farming.</p>



<p>“The Minister has come up with a programme on cassava, rice and maize and we want to engage in that programme and urgently make sure we improve on our yield and deliver to the Nigerian population.</p>



<p>“We want to get to a stage where we export our food. What we have now is that, because of the devaluation of our naira, Nigeria’s food is being exported to West Africa and is the cheapest in the region today.”</p>



<p>He explained that the governors had “come to the realisation that we have a new Ministry of Agriculture, because over the last four years, before this administration, the engagement was not too productive.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“This was because the CBN took over most of what the agriculture ministry use to do. Our trips to the ministry at that time were not fruitful. But now we have seen strong engagement and sense from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and that is why we are here today.”, Abdulrazaq stressed.</p>



<p>The Kwara Governor also said the governors had also noted that food in Nigeria was the cheapest in West Africa, adding that Nigeria’s neighbours were using its food to trade.</p>



<p>As a result, he said, “They are taking our soya and other stuff to make foreign exchange for themselves. That is not a bad thing. What we need to do is to ramp up production and increase our yields per hectare so that we can feed West Africa, feed ourselves 100 per cent and export food. That is the goal we must achieve…. whatever subsidy that is coming from the federal government will be improved upon by the states.”</p>



<p>According to the report, Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Senator&nbsp; Abubakar Kyari, described the four governors’ visit as a huge endorsement for the progressive drive towards the much-needed collaboration between the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and state governments.</p>



<p>According to him: “It is with a view to creating an agricultural sector fit for a nation as endowed as Nigeria with massive arable fertile land, abundant water resources and agricultural labour force. This visit is, in my view, beyond a courtesy call. The bigger picture we seek to create now is to vastly increase agricultural production all year round.</p>



<p>“This is with the cardinal objective of driving down food inflation, creating employment, reducing poverty, engendering economic growth and development, as well promoting inclusivity.”</p>



<p>He explained further: “Ahead of the second phase of the Dry Season Food Production Programme under the National Agricultural Growth Scheme and Agro-Pocket, I sent out Expression of Interests to the governors of the 36 States and Federal Capital Territory, to which responses have been encouraging.</p>



<p>“Indeed, a number of governors have paid visits to our corporate headquarters here. These include the Governors of Jigawa, Katsina, Ekiti, Niger, Kebbi, and Sokoto states in furtherance of the collaboration that we are seeking for the success of the Dry Season Food Production Programme.”</p>



<p>President Bola Tinubu had in February, 2024, met with all 36 state governors under the auspices of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum at the Council Chamber of the State House, Abuja.
