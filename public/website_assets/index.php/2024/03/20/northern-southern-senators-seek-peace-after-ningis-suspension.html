<p>Recent Pledges by new leadership of Northern and Southern Senators’ Groups to work together in the 10th Senate have created a fresh atmosphere for peace in the Red Chamber. <strong>Sunday Aborisade</strong> reports.</p>



<p>New leadership emerged last week in the Northern Senators Forum (NSF) and Southern Senators Forum (SSF) following the amicable resolution of the crisis of confidence ignited by the erstwhile Chairman of the NSF, Senator Abdul Ningi (Bauchi Central).</p>



<p>Ningi had used the platform of the NSF to making disparaging comments against the President Bola Tinubu’s administration and the leadership of the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio in the red chamber.</p>



<p>He had claimed that the current budget being operated in Nigeria was different from the fiscal document passed by the National Assembly last December.</p>



<p>Ningi had also claimed that about N3.7trn allegedly inserted in the budget being implemented were not tied to any project, neither were the locations of the projects identified.</p>



<p>The Bauchi Central Senatorial District Senator had also alleged in an interview he granted to the Hausa Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that the fiscal document was skewed in favour of the South.</p>



<p>When the matter came up at plenary last week Tuesday following a motion by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Solomon Adeola, some Northern Senators across party lines solicited the understanding of the Senate to forgive Ningi if he apologized to the Red Chamber over his excesses and misinformation.</p>



<p>The insistence of the majority of the Senators across party lines and geopolitical devide, forced the upper chamber to sanction him.</p>



<p>The eventual suspension of the embattled Bauchi Senator for three months by the Senate after a rowdy session, and his resignation as chairman of the NSF, had led to the emergence of a new leadership in the Northern Senators camp with Senator Abdulaziz Yar’adua (Katsina Central) as Chairman.</p>



<p>The Forum also named Senator Muhammed Tahir Munguno (Borno North) as its new spokesperson to replace Senator Sumaila Kawu.</p>



<p>Yar’adua is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Army while Monguno is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.</p>



<p>The announcement was made at plenary by&nbsp; President of the senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio on Thursday.</p>



<p>Yar’adua in his acceptance speech said he was deeply honoured and humbled to communicate to his colleagues in the Forum his acceptance as the Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum.</p>



<p>He thanked the Northern Senators for the confidence reposed in him and pledged to work towards a harmonious relationship between them and their southern colleagues in order to achieve peace in the 10th Senate.</p>



<p>Yar’adua also vowed to address the challenges facing the northern region through effective legislation and collaboration with the leadership of the Senate and senators from the southern part of the country.</p>



<p>He said, “I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my distinguished colleagues for this vote of confidence in me following the resignation of my distinguished elder brother, Senator Abdul Ningi whom I hold in high esteem.</p>



<p>“I wish to acknowledge and commend the decent outing and the contributions he made during his tenure.</p>



<p>“I am aware of the challenges facing the Northern region which Include security, agriculture, education, healthcare, drug abuse and human trafficking. Others are so numerous to mention.</p>



<p>“The major objective of the Northern Forum is to promote the interest of Nigeria first followed by development of the North through collaboration with our distinguished colleagues from the South and cooperating with the executive arm of government to ensure that the challenges of the region are attended to.</p>



<p>“We shall therefore work in consultation with our distinguished colleagues to preserve the unity and progress of our dear nation. In advancing these noble objectives, I am committed to streamlined activities within the Northem Senators Forum. We shall operate with transparency, accountability, and integrity, upholding the trust placed on us by the electorate.</p>



<p>“Our legislative discourse will continue to be characterized by civility, dignity, and adherence to the rule of law as we fulfill our lawmaking, policy-making, and oversight functions. I am confident that with our collective efforts and cooperation, we can effect positive change, uplift the North, and contribute to the overall development of our great nation.</p>



<p>“Together, let us embark on this journey with unwavering dedication and a steadfast commitment to serving our constituents and our country. May our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a shared vision for a better and brighter future”</p>



<p>Speaking with newsmen shortly after his announcement, Yar’adua also promised to deploy diplomacy and lobbying to perfect a soft landing for Ningi so that he could join his colleagues before the expiration of his three months suspension.</p>



<p>Similarly, in their quest to achieve a peaceful coexistence in the 10th Senate, members of the Southern Senators Forum, also last week, elected their new officers.</p>



<p>The Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking Insurance and other Financial Institutions, Senator Adetokunbo Abiru, emerged Chairman of the Forum.</p>



<p>Abiru who is representing Lagos East Senatorial District on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, took over from the Senate Leader, Opeyemi Bamidele, who has been the Chairman of the forum since the 9th Assembly.</p>



<p>The Vice Chairman of the forum is Senator Victor Umeh (Anambra Central); the Secretary is Mpigi Barinada (Rivers South East), the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the forum is Asuquo Ekpenyong (Rivers South) while Kenneth Eze (Ebonyi Central) emerged as the treasurer of the forum.</p>



<p>Speaking after his election at a meeting of Senators from the South West, South South and the South East, Abiru said they will partner with the Northern Senators Forum to move the country forward.</p>



<p>According to him: “The Southern Senators Forum is to champion the course of Nigeria and Nigerians. We have our northern brothers with the Northern Senators Forum. We will work together with them to move the country forward”.</p>



<p>The Lagos East Senator said his leadership would swing into action and roll out plans for the betterment of the region and Nigeria.</p>



<p>“We will work out our plans,” Abiru said adding that the last leadership had transferred power to them.</p>



<p>His words: “The last leadership has transferred power to us. We’ve been running the Forum as if we don’t exist. The present leader of the Senate was the leader of the Southern Senators Forum. He was too engaged on other issues but we now have new leadership which is headed by me”.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Sani Musa who is representing Niger East Senatorial District, has described as untrue, allegations in some quarters that he was working against the interest of the North.</p>



<p>Musa in a statement last weekend explained that he stayed away from the NSF activities for some time because the Abdul Ningi leadership was not carrying him and many others along in their decisions.</p>



<p>He said, “I would like to address the recent accusations levelled against me regarding my alleged betrayal of the North. As a Senator, my commitment to the Northern Senators Forum and the development of the North, Nigeria, and the integrity of the Senate as an institution has always been unwavering. In my capacity as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and an active member of the Northern Senators Forum, I have consistently supported and advocated for the interests of the North.</p>



<p>“However, it is imperative for me, as a responsible representative, to be kept informed and included in matters that concern our region and our nation. Regrettably, there have been instances where I have felt excluded from crucial discussions, particularly concerning Appropriations. Despite my repeated attempts to address this issue with the Forum’s Secretary and Spokesman, transparency and inclusivity have not been forthcoming.</p>



<p>“My recent statement was not intended as a betrayal but rather as a plea for transparency and fair representation. How can I be expected to support or contribute affirmatively to decisions when I am not privy to the necessary information? I remain steadfast in my dedication to serving my Senatorial District, the North, Nigeria, and the Senate with integrity and accountability. It is my sincere hope that we can work together to ensure the interests of all stakeholders are upheld”.</p>



<p>Keen watchers of political development in the Red Chamber are, however, quick to stress that the instant revival of the Southern Senators Forum might not be unconnected with the alarm raised on the floor of the Senate last Tuesday by the former Chairman of the Forum who is now the Leader of the Senate, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele.</p>



<p>Bamidele had alleged that the Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum, Senator Abdul Ningi, was acting the script of some people using the NSF platform working towards the impeachment of the Senate President before June this year.</p>



<p>An obviously enraged Bamidele had said, “We must never accept any apology from Senator Ningi. It is ridiculous to do so. He lied deliberately. Mr Senate President Godswill Akpabio), you’re occupying that seat 40 years after a South South person occupied it.</p>



<p>“The last time a southerner was there was during Obasanjo and they were being changed every time. It was only stable when it returned to the North. David Mark spent eight years, Saraki completed his four years, Lawan spent his four years. Don’t be deceived, the losers of June 2023 Senate President election are still angry. Some have accepted but a few haven’t. They have plotted to remove you before June 2024. That is why you must not allow this deliberate mischief by Ningi to go away. He did it on purpose.</p>



<p>He knew he was lying, he set the public against you, he will do it again. We must apply our sanction,” Bamidele had alleged.</p>

We’ve been running the Forum as if we don’t exist. The present leader of the Senate was the leader of the Southern Senators Forum.

As a Senator, my commitment to the Northern Senators Forum and the development of the North, Nigeria, and the integrity of the Senate as an institution has always been unwavering. In my capacity as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and an active member of the Northern Senators Forum, I have consistently supported and advocated for the interests of the North.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“However, it is imperative for me, as a responsible representative, to be kept informed and included in matters that concern our region and our nation. Regrettably, there have been instances where I have felt excluded from crucial discussions, particularly concerning Appropriations. Despite my repeated attempts to address this issue with the Forum’s Secretary and Spokesman, transparency and inclusivity have not been forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“My recent statement was not intended as a betrayal but rather as a plea for transparency and fair representation. How can I be expected to support or contribute affirmatively to decisions when I am not privy to the necessary information? I remain steadfast in my dedication to serving my Senatorial District, the North, Nigeria, and the Senate with integrity and accountability. It is my sincere hope that we can work together to ensure the interests of all stakeholders are upheld”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeen watchers of political development in the Red Chamber are, however, quick to stress that the instant revival of the Southern Senators Forum might not be unconnected with the alarm raised on the floor of the Senate last Tuesday by the former Chairman of the Forum who is now the Leader of the Senate, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBamidele had alleged that the Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum, Senator Abdul Ningi, was acting the script of some people using the NSF platform working towards the impeachment of the Senate President before June this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn obviously enraged Bamidele had said, “We must never accept any apology from Senator Ningi. It is ridiculous to do so. He lied deliberately. Mr Senate President Godswill Akpabio), you’re occupying that seat 40 years after a South South person occupied it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The last time a southerner was there was during Obasanjo and they were being changed every time. It was only stable when it returned to the North. David Mark spent eight years, Saraki completed his four years, Lawan spent his four years. Don’t be deceived, the losers of June 2023 Senate President election are still angry. Some have accepted but a few haven’t. They have plotted to remove you before June 2024. That is why you must not allow this deliberate mischief by Ningi to go away. He did it on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was lying, he set the public against you, he will do it again.
