<p>No doubt, the Nigerian banking industry has recorded several exciting developments in recent times &#8211; its resilience amid domestic and global headwinds – reflected in the consistent industry profitability. But perhaps, the most intriguing trend is the unprecedented traction towards gender inclusion, in an industry where the male dominated the board and management positions, writes&nbsp;<strong>James Emejo</strong></p>



<p>It can be argued that the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) efforts towards the inclusion of women in top positions in the industry are beginning to yield positive results.</p>



<p>The bank had issued a policy that required a minimum of 30 per cent of female representation on boards and 40 per cent at the top management level in the banking spectrum</p>



<p>Today, the rise of female chief executives in Nigerian banks underscores the growing recognition of women’s potential and contribution to the country’s economic development, and reflects a progressive shift towards gender equality and inclusivity in corporate governance, signaling a departure from traditional patriarchal structures towards a more equitable and diverse leadership paradigm.</p>



<p>Today, 11 female bankers have been elevated to assume the roles of managing directors and chief executives of banks, a development deemed as positive for the sector and the country in general.</p>
