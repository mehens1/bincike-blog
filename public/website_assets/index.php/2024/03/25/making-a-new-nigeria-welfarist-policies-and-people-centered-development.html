<p><strong>By Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, CON</strong></p>



<p>My darling wife, Grace (Yemisi) and I are simply overwhelmed with emotion, overjoyed and filled with very deep and sincere appreciation, for your being here on this occasion, and for all your heartfelt well wishes.</p>



<p><br>I am greatly honored and humbled by the very large and significant presence of leaders from my home country Nigeria, from Africa, and other parts of the world.</p>



<p><br>I am enormously honoured and humbled that Excellencies Presidents and Heads of State of African countries have travelled to be here, specially, for this occasion.</p>



<p><br>The conferment of this award today, March 6, 2024, coincides with what would have marked Chief Awolowo’s 115th birthday, and 37 years since his passing.</p>



<p><br>May Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s soul continue to rest in peace, even as we draw inspiring lessons from his life, policies and philosophy.<br>I have received several global awards, for which I am very grateful. Receiving the Awolowo Prize for Leadership is particularly very special. That’s because it brings back so many personal memories.</p>



<p><br>Growing up in the old Western Region of Nigeria in the 1960s, only one name was synonymous with people-centred development: Awolowo. We lived in the same community as the sage, in Okebola, Ibadan. As a young child, passing by<br>the frontage of his house was a favourite pastime. I remember peering over its low walls, to see if I could just catch a glimpse of the man who transformed the lives of millions in the then Western region. My father was enamoured by Chief Awolowo: he devoured his books, writings and articles. The name ‘Awolowo’ was a constant guidepost for every discussion in our home.</p>



<p><br>So much was the admiration that when I was 19 years old and Chief Awolowo ran for President under the Unity Party of Nigeria in 1979, myself and a close friend desperately wanted to simply catch a glimpse of him. When we arrived at Tafawa Balewa in Lagos, the stands and the grounds were packed to capacity.</p>



<p><br>The gates were locked. But we were absolutely undeterred. We had travelled all the way from Ife and would not be denied. So, we climbed the tall steel gates of the Square. An unbelievable height when I look at it today.</p>



<p><br>Once we scaled through, we ran up close to the stage where he was speaking from and proudly stood just one arms length from him and his dear wife, Mama Hannah Dideolu Awolowo. Just a glimpse was enough. We listened with rapt attention to the exposition of his plans for Nigeria. We were mesmerized.</p>



<p><br>Like a fragrance his words took our breath away: we could smell hope in the air. Hope that Nigeria would be great. Hope that education would be free at all levels. Hope that there would be health for all. Hope that the remarkable transformation witnessed in the Western region of Nigeria, in education, agriculture, health, and infrastructure, undergirded by a highly professional and disciplined civil service, would soon take hold in Nigeria.</p>



<p><br>Like the refrains of an orchestra, the sounds of Awo, Awo, filled the air, as our hopes were raised. We could see a new Nigeria. Alas, this was not to be.</p>



<p><br>Nigeria missed its best opportunity to be great under ‘President’ Awolowo. Chief Emeka Ojukwu, said of him “the best President that Nigeria never had.”<br>Let me say clearly: Chief Awolowo was bigger than Nigeria. He was the pacesetter and forerunner for development in Africa. His intellectual capacity, vision, pragmatic social welfarism, helped him accomplish what was seemingly unimaginable at the time. He built the first skyscraper in Africa – the Cocoa House. He built the first television station in Africa, WNTV. He built the Liberty Stadium, the first of its kind in Africa. He implemented a blueprint for development that focused on building human capacity through massive programs to educate people, develop skills, lift people out of poverty, provide massive rural infrastructure, and develop institutions that turned farmers into wealthy entrepreneurs.</p>



<p><br>I dare say that Chief Awolowo implemented the sustainable development goals decades long before the phrase was coined. He was an inspiration for Africa, far beyond the shores of Nigeria. His philosophy “Awoism” was studied globally and helped shape programs and policies in other countries.<br>Today, my lecture is titled: Making a New Nigeria: Welfarist Policies and People-Centered Development.</p>



<p><br>From my early days, I was influenced by the same drive as Chief Awolowo. I promised myself then that if I ever got into any public position, I would run welfarist and people-centric policies.</p>



<p><br>My heartbeat has always been about people. Nothing more. Nothing less. My life is only as useful to the extent that it is used of God to do my utmost to transform the lives of people. Awo inspired me. Decades ago, the perfume of building hope rubbed off on me. It’s a fragrance that still lingers today. So, as I stand before you to receive the Obafemi Awolowo Prize for Leadership, I am humbled, inspired and motivated.</p>



<p><br>I feel a new sense of responsibility. I am reminded today of the words of Martin Luther King Jnr, “History has thrust upon me a responsibility from which I cannot turn away.”</p>



<p><br>Yes, I have a dream of a better and prosperous Nigeria. Yes, I have a dream of a globally respected Africa. Yes, I have a dream that Africa will not be condemned to the bottom rungs of the global economic ladder. I refuse to accept poverty’s imprint on Africa. I still believe that Nigeria will rise again. I still believe that Africa will shine and fulfil its destiny. I still believe that we shall be who we are meant to be.</p>



<p><br>Today, I accept this Prize as a trustee of hope for millions of our people. You bestow upon me this honour at a momentous period of great global challenges, from rising debt, climate change, fragilities and vulnerabilities. Your honour is a call to do more amid these challenges.</p>



<p><br>So, I celebrate with measure, as I know with all humility the work of making Nigeria great, and by implication making Africa great, is still in progress. It is my lifelong mission to do all I can to improve the lives of all Africans. The wind of challenges may sometimes shift us away from our destined path, albeit momentarily, but we shall overcome our challenges.</p>



<p><br>Nigeria must dream. Africa must dream. Yes, we may have challenges, yet all I see tells me we will get there.</p>



<p><br>We must start by unleashing our full potential while managing our challenges. We must make poverty history in Nigeria. We must make poverty history in Africa. We must deliver a better Nigeria, and a better Africa, for this generation and generations to come.</p>



<p><br>Given the high level of poverty in Africa and Nigeria, what is needed are welfarist policies that exponentially expand opportunities for all, reduce inequalities, and improve the quality of life of people. These must be anchored on public-centric policies and private wealth creation for all. I would like to focus on five areas.</p>



<p><br>First, rural economic transformation and food security. Second, health care security for all. Third, education for all. Fourth, access to affordable housing for all. Fifth, government accountability and fiscal decentralization for true federalism. First, Nigeria must completely transform its rural economies to ensure food security for all. A better Africa must start with the transformation of rural economies. That is because some 70% of the population live there. Rural poverty is extremely high. At the heart of transforming rural economies is agriculture, the main source of livelihoods.</p>



<p><br>When agriculture moves away from being a way of life to a business, everything changes. Higher incomes and wages from agribusinesses will support education and health, and spur even greater job creation for millions of youths. As a young student who attended high school in the village, I witnessed the high correlation of agricultural performance with education. Several of my classmates were children of farmers. I noticed then that when the agricultural season was good, they stayed in school and performed well, but when the season was poor, several dropped out or attended intermittently.</p>



<p><br>The decision by Chief Awolowo to start with the transformation of the rural economy was a very sound policy. The establishment of farm estates, and the expansion of rural roads, supported by professionally run marketing boards helped stabilize the prices of farm produce. It is worth noting that the prudent fiscal management of the cocoa revenues powered the economies of the States that then constituted the Western Region. These revenues allowed the government to embark on an unprecedented idea &#8211; free education and free basic health care services. It was common then to hear the phrase “Agbe lo ba” (farmers are kings), uttered with great pride. We must give new life to our rural areas.</p>



<p><br>If Chief Awolowo could do this in the 1960s, there is no reason why rural economies today should be immersed in extreme poverty. Clearly, rural economies have been abandoned, by politicians, planning and policies. Today, they have become zones of economic misery. The pauperization of rural economies is what is causing the implosion of many countries across Africa. When rural economies (the fulcrum of the African society) falter, nations falter. This leads to the spread of anarchy, banditry, and terrorism. This troika of social disruption takes advantage of the economic misery to entrench themselves.</p>



<p><br>The transformation of rural economies must therefore be structural, systemic, strategic and comprehensive. Doing so means agriculture must be turned into a wealth-creating sector.</p>



<p><br>I aggressively pursued this philosophy when I served as minister of agriculture and rural development of Nigeria from 2011-2015. Many call this period the “farm revolution” years, as Nigeria witnessed an impressive transformation of its agricultural sector.</p>



<p><br>With farmer-centric policies, we delivered improved seeds and fertilizers for 15 million farmers. We delivered millions of cocoa seedlings across southern Nigeria. We delivered a cotton transformation across the north. We provided millions of oil palm seedlings to farm estates, including small farmers and large farm estates, across the East, South and West. We accelerated the delivery of improved rice seeds across Nigeria and sparked a rice revolution that transformed several regions across Nigeria.</p>



<p><br>Sound public policies transform the lives of people. I fondly remember one of my farm trips in the company of the then Governor of Kebbi State, H.E. Usman Dakingari. Amazed by the revolution happening, I recall him saying, “Minister, thank you, we no longer measure our rice yields in hectares of land but in kilometres.”</p>



<p><br>Rural economies boomed. Local well-packaged rice took over the market. The price of rice at the time was N6,000 per bag, which helped to stem food price inflation. Unfortunately, today, that same bag of rice, just nine years later, is N77,000 per bag. That 12-fold price increase unfortunately puts rice, a basic staple, beyond the reach of millions of people.</p>



<p><br>In several parts of Africa today, farm revolutions are happening at scale, with the support of the African Development Bank. Over the last seven years, we have invested over $8.5 billion in agriculture, which has impacted 250 million people.</p>



<p><br>At the core of the Africa-wide strategy to revamp rural economies and turn them into zones of economic prosperity is the development of special agro-industrial processing zones across the continent.</p>



<p><br>These zones are being provided with critical supportive infrastructure, including water, roads, processing infrastructure and logistics. The African Development Bank and its partners are providing $1.4 billion for the development of 25 Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones in eleven countries.</p>



<p><br>Right here in Nigeria, we are developing these zones in 8 states with $518 million. The second phase of the program in Nigeria, which will cover 23 more States, will be financed with $1 billion. The Bank and partners recently launched a $3 billion Alliance for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones.<br>Feeding Africa is serious business.</p>



<p><br>To ensure that the continent can feed itself and achieve food sovereignty, we organised the Feed Africa Summit in January of 2023, which had 34 African<br>Heads of State and the President of Ireland are in attendance, as well as global leaders.</p>



<p><br>In what is a remarkable global development, we were able to secure $72 billion in financial commitments towards the delivery of national food compacts. Second, Nigeria needs health care for all. Smart governments provide universal basic health coverage for their citizens. Africa loses $2.6 trillion annually in productivity, due to sicknesses and diseases. Just as every nation has a national defense system to protect its citizens against all forms of aggression, the same is true for healthcare systems. A nation without a sound health care system is a nation that is defenseless against the invasion of all forms of disease or epidemics.</p>



<p><br>Covid-19 exposed the weakness of Africa’s health systems.</p>



<p><br>While developed economies spent $19 trillion in fiscal stimulus programmes, approximately 19% of the world’s GDP, Africa spent only $89 billion. Africa’s urgent need for basic vaccines was pushed to the bottom of global vaccine supply chains. At a time when Africa was unable to provide one basic shot of vaccine, developed countries were providing second, third and more booster shots. It was alarming watching an unprotected Africa grapple with this<br>insidious virus. Some even projected that as many as 3 million Africans would die from the pandemic. Africa had just two testing centres, no medical gloves, no face masks, no medications, no vaccines. The African Development Bank immediately put in place a $10 billion facility to support African countries in their fight against the pandemic.</p>



<p><br>What is not acceptable or sustainable is an Africa that imports 70-80% of its medicines and produces just 1% of its vaccines.. The health security of Africa’s 1.4 billion people cannot be subjugated to global supply chains or the generosity of others.</p>



<p><br>That’s why the African Development Bank also launched a $3 billion programme to revamp Africa’s pharmaceutical industries and why it established the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation to support access to proprietary technologies from global pharmaceutical companies.</p>



<p><br>The Bank also launched another $3 billion program to develop quality health infrastructure across the continent, with special emphasis on primary health care systems, which if well fixed can assure basic health care for hundreds of millions of people.</p>



<p><br>We will continue to invest heavily in Nigeria to support its pharmaceutical industry and develop better health infrastructure. It is imperative that Nigeria secures the health of all its population. This will require ensuring that no citizen travels more than a few kilometers to find a healthcare centre. The widespread use of mobile health centres, e-health facilities, the digitalization of health systems, especially in all primary health care centres and health insurance policies for all, including innovative micro-health insurance pay-as-you-go systems, will capture the bulk of the population that is in the informal sector.</p>



<p><br>Third, Nigeria needs education for all.</p>



<p><br>Nigeria accounts for 15% of the total population of out-of-school children, according to UNICEF, with over 10.2 million at the primary school level, and 8.1 million at the Junior Secondary School. This is not a gold medal Nigeria should be</p>



<p><br>proud of. The problem is both acute and alarming in Northern Nigeria. Urgent public policies, coupled with community sensitization and incentives for schooling are needed, if this trend is to be reversed. Public incentives such as free and 12 compulsory primary and secondary education should be put in place, along with massive investments in training and better salaries for teachers, building quality and safe classrooms, and school feeding programmes.<br>A well-educated citizenry is critical for technological growth and development, and for fostering creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and global competitiveness. We do not have a choice. A highly educated Nigeria is not an option. It is an imperative.</p>



<p><br>With only 1% of the population enrolled, Nigeria is currently not educating enough of its people at the university level. The poor funding of universities, lack of basic infrastructure, poor incentives for faculty and staff, and incessant strikes due to wage disputes, have almost crippled the university system.<br>As a result, there is a mass exodus out of Nigerian universities, with 128,770<br>Nigerian students “Japa-ing” (moving) to study in UK Universities alone, between 2015 and 2022, according to the Higher Education Agency of the United Kingdom. The mass exodus of students pales when compared to those of skilled professionals. From doctors to engineers, architects, lawyers, IT specialists, bankers, and medical technicians, Nigeria is witnessing a massive depletion of its human capital. This human capital hemorrhage will slow down economic growth, performance and overall development and competitiveness of the economy. While one might argue that a growing diaspora is good as they send home some $ billions which is higher than the oil export earnings, this clearly is not the way to develop sustainably.</p>



<p><br>Nations that develop do all they can to keep their best human capital at home, and additionally source skills from elsewhere with flexible immigration and haemorrhage policies. We must make Nigeria a viable place for people to stay, and not a place to run away from. The same applies for other countries. I refuse to believe that the future of Nigeria’s and Africa’s youth lie in Europe, North America, Asia or anywhere else.</p>



<p><br>I firmly believe that their future lies in a rapidly developing Nigeria, and Africa, that is able to generate quality jobs with competitive wages and a decent quality of life for millions of youths. That is why the African Development Bank Group and partners have provided $614 million to Nigeria for the i-DICE programme to support the development of digital and creative enterprises, which are expected to create 6.3 million jobs and add an estimated $6.4 billion to the Nigerian economy.</p>



<p><br>To support the businesses of young Nigerians, the African Development Bank Group is also planning to establish a Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank in Nigeria which will provide financial instruments to create youth-based wealth. Fourth, Nigeria needs housing for all.</p>



<p><br>A better quality of life requires access to decent and affordable housing for all. I remember growing up, how hard my father worked to be able to build us a decent house to stay in, after living for years in high-density areas, in what is called face-me-I-face you. What a joy it was to finally have our own rooms with baths and toilets. This joy eludes hundreds of millions of people in Africa, yet several governments stand watch undeterred and unflinching as millions of their citizens live in slums. Today over 65% of people in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums. Let me bring this closer home.</p>



<p><br>In Nigeria, 49% of the population live in slums, according to data by UN-Habitat. That is a staggering 102 million people! These trends need to change, rapidly. Welfarist policies are urgently needed to ensure that 100% of citizens have access to basic and affordable housing. The opprobrious policies that seek to upgrade slums should be jettisoned. There is nothing like a 5-star slum: a slum is a slum.Urgent actions are needed to support mortgage financing and re-financing andthe use of innovative financing structures to raise long-term capital for closing the housing deficits.</p>



<p><br>Fifth, Nigeria needs government accountability and fiscal decentralization for a true federalism. Democracy is more than the right to cast a vote. It is the right of citizens to hold governments accountable for improvements in their welfare. Citizen accountability forums are needed in order to have a say in how their nation’s resources are being used and how their governments are performing. Governments must show concrete and transparent evidence of fiscal responsibility.<br>Governments without citizen accountability become synonyms for democratic dictatorship.</p>



<p><br>Today, therefore, there is a greater need for e-governance systems to enhance transparency and accountability of governments, in service of the people.<br>That is what people-centred governance is all about.</p>



<p><br>That is why the African Development Bank is developing a public service delivery index that will rate governments on the quality-of-service delivery for citizens.<br>Development clearly requires a significant amount of financing, which governments need to raise. A primary tool for doing so is through taxation. The rationale for raising taxes in Nigeria is that the nation’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low compared to other African or non-African countries. However, taxation in the absence of a social contract between governments and citizens is simply fiscal extortion.</p>



<p><br>Participatory tax-based financing systems demand participatory governance. Take the case of Norway for instance. Its tax-to-GDP ratio is 39%. It is easy to make the comparison and say Nigeria needs to raise its taxes from 6.1% of GDP to a similar level as Norway.</p>



<p><br>But consider that in Norway, like all the Nordic countries, education is free through university. And if you finish your course on time, any loans you took to feed yourself, clothe yourself and maintain yourself, are converted into grants. We must distinguish between nominal taxes and implicit taxes — taxes that are borne by the people but are not seen or recorded.</p>



<p><br>Truth be told, Nigerians pay one of the highest implicit tax rates in the world. Most of the citizens provide electricity for themselves via generators; they repair roads in their neighborhoods if they can afford to. They provide boreholes<br>for drinking water with their own monies. In the 21st century, this is incredulous as every household should have pipe borne water!<br>Sadly, the abnormal has been normalized.</p>



<p><br>If people pay taxes, governments must deliver services to citizens and be held accountable for their ability to do so or not. Governments should not transfer their responsibility to citizens. When governments or institutions fail to provide basic services, the people bear the burden of a heavy implicit tax.<br>To succeed with much needed welfarist and people-centered policies across Nigeria, it is necessary to change the governance system and decentralize governance to States in order to provide greater autonomy.</p>



<p><br>States have tremendous potential to become even more financially autonomous through greater fiscal prudence. If States focus on unlocking thehuge resources they have, based on areas of comparative advantage, they will rapidly expand wealth for their people. With such increased wealth, they will be able to access capital markets and secure long-term financing to fast-track their growth<br>and development. States that adopt this strategy would have less of a need for monthly trips to Abuja for grants. Instead, part of their federal revenue allocations can be saved as internal &#8216;state sovereign wealth funds&#8217;. This can then be used as guarantees against borrowings from capital markets. In essence, they would be free from needing to exclusively rely on the federal government.</p>



<p><br>To get out of the economic quagmire, there is a compelling need for the restructuring of Nigeria. Restructuring should not be driven by political expediency, but by economic and financial viability. Economic and financial viability are the necessary and sufficient conditions for political viability.</p>



<p><br>If there was one attribute that defined Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and there were many, it would be his visionary boldness. He went where others feared or failed to go. In the process, decades later, his footprints remain in the sands of time.</p>



<p><br>Likewise today, in Nigeria, we need men and women with vision, who are willing to take bold decisions.</p>



<p><br>Surgeries are tough. They are better done well, the first time. The resources found in each state or state groupings should belong to them. The constituent entities should pay federal taxes or royalties for those resources.</p>



<p><br>But lets be clear. The achievement of economically viable entities and the viability of the national entity requires constitutional changes to devolve more economic and fiscal powers to the states or regions. The stronger the states, or regions, the stronger the federated units.<br>In the process, our union would be renewed. Our union would be stronger. Our union would be equitable. Our union would be fully participatory.<br>Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen. We must be audacious!<br>Instead of a Federal Government of Nigeria, we could think of The United<br>States of Nigeria.</p>



<p><br>The old would give way to the new. We would change the relational mindset between the states and Abuja: the fulcrum would be the states, while the center would support them, not lord over them.</p>



<p><br>With good governance and better accountability systems, and a zero tolerance for corruption, more economically stronger constituent states would emerge! We would unleash massive wealth across the states.</p>



<p><br>A New Nigeria would arise!</p>



<p><br>To do so, we will need all of us &#8211; not some of us. From our forgotten rural villages to our boisterous and dynamic urban areas. From the sparks of desire in the eyes of our children, to the lingering hope in the hearts of our youth.</p>



<p><br>From the yearnings of our women and mothers and our men and fathers for a better tomorrow, and the desires of the old that our end would be better than our past.</p>



<p><br>From the hardworking street vendors and small businesses to the largest business conglomerates … we must create a movement of hope.<br>Hope for a better Nigeria!</p>



<p><br>Not a Muslim Nigeria. Not a Christian Nigeria. Not Eastern Nigeria, Western Nigeria, or Northern or Southern Nigeria. But one Nigeria &#8211; a New Nigeria, created by a renewed commitment to turn our amazing diversity into exceptional strength.</p>



<p><br>A New Nigeria, powered by torrents of hope, trust, equity, fairness, and wealth at every level, in every state … by all and for all. We have the capacity to do this and make it happen.</p>



<p><br>We must rise above mistrust and divisions and make history. Not the history that is written about us, about Northern Nigeria, Southern Nigeria, Eastern Nigeria, or Western Nigeria.</p>



<p><br>Not the history of divisive political parties; but a new history that we commit to write for ourselves &#8211; the history of a New Nigeria. We are the history makers. So, let us commit to make history for a New Nigeria!</p>



<p><br>For the darkness of today will soon fade. It will not be long before our star shines brighter as a nation, as welfarist policies and people-centered policies spur shared wealth. A nation where majority prosper, not just a privileged few. A nation that provides real opportunities for the youth. A nation where equality of opportunities for women is a reality, not a dream. A nation where hope is ignited, and dreams are realized. A nation known for wealth, not poverty. A nation set on a hill whose light will never be hidden. A New Nigeria that we all are proud to call home. So, help us God!<br>Thank you very much.</p>

Receiving the Awolowo Prize for Leadership is particularly very special. That’s because it brings back so many personal memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in the old Western Region of Nigeria in the 1960s, only one name was synonymous with people-centred development: Awolowo. We lived in the same community as the sage, in Okebola, Ibadan. As a young child, passing by\u003cbr\u003ethe frontage of his house was a favourite pastime. I remember peering over its low walls, to see if I could just catch a glimpse of the man who transformed the lives of millions in the then Western region. My father was enamoured by Chief Awolowo: he devoured his books, writings and articles. The name ‘Awolowo’ was a constant guidepost for every discussion in our home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much was the admiration that when I was 19 years old and Chief Awolowo ran for President under the Unity Party of Nigeria in 1979, myself and a close friend desperately wanted to simply catch a glimpse of him. When we arrived at Tafawa Balewa in Lagos, the stands and the grounds were packed to capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gates were locked. But we were absolutely undeterred. We had travelled all the way from Ife and would not be denied. So, we climbed the tall steel gates of the Square. An unbelievable height when I look at it today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we scaled through, we ran up close to the stage where he was speaking from and proudly stood just one arms length from him and his dear wife, Mama Hannah Dideolu Awolowo. Just a glimpse was enough. We listened with rapt attention to the exposition of his plans for Nigeria. We were mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike a fragrance his words took our breath away: we could smell hope in the air. Hope that Nigeria would be great. Hope that education would be free at all levels. Hope that there would be health for all. Hope that the remarkable transformation witnessed in the Western region of Nigeria, in education, agriculture, health, and infrastructure, undergirded by a highly professional and disciplined civil service, would soon take hold in Nigeria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike the refrains of an orchestra, the sounds of Awo, Awo, filled the air, as our hopes were raised. We could see a new Nigeria. Alas, this was not to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNigeria missed its best opportunity to be great under ‘President’ Awolowo. Chief Emeka Ojukwu, said of him “the best President that Nigeria never had.”\u003cbr\u003eLet me say clearly: Chief Awolowo was bigger than Nigeria. He was the pacesetter and forerunner for development in Africa. His intellectual capacity, vision, pragmatic social welfarism, helped him accomplish what was seemingly unimaginable at the time. He built the first skyscraper in Africa – the Cocoa House. He built the first television station in Africa, WNTV. He built the Liberty Stadium, the first of its kind in Africa. He implemented a blueprint for development that focused on building human capacity through massive programs to educate people, develop skills, lift people out of poverty, provide massive rural infrastructure, and develop institutions that turned farmers into wealthy entrepreneurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dare say that Chief Awolowo implemented the sustainable development goals decades long before the phrase was coined. He was an inspiration for Africa, far beyond the shores of Nigeria. His philosophy “Awoism” was studied globally and helped shape programs and policies in other countries.\u003cbr\u003eToday, my lecture is titled: Making a New Nigeria: Welfarist Policies and People-Centered Development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom my early days, I was influenced by the same drive as Chief Awolowo. I promised myself then that if I ever got into any public position, I would run welfarist and people-centric policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heartbeat has always been about people. Nothing more. Nothing less. My life is only as useful to the extent that it is used of God to do my utmost to transform the lives of people. Awo inspired me. Decades ago, the perfume of building hope rubbed off on me. It’s a fragrance that still lingers today. So, as I stand before you to receive the Obafemi Awolowo Prize for Leadership, I am humbled, inspired and motivated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel a new sense of responsibility. I am reminded today of the words of Martin Luther King Jnr, “History has thrust upon me a responsibility from which I cannot turn away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I have a dream of a better and prosperous Nigeria. Yes, I have a dream of a globally respected Africa. Yes, I have a dream that Africa will not be condemned to the bottom rungs of the global economic ladder. I refuse to accept poverty’s imprint on Africa. I still believe that Nigeria will rise again. I still believe that Africa will shine and fulfil its destiny. I still believe that we shall be who we are meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I accept this Prize as a trustee of hope for millions of our people. You bestow upon me this honour at a momentous period of great global challenges, from rising debt, climate change, fragilities and vulnerabilities. Your honour is a call to do more amid these challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I celebrate with measure, as I know with all humility the work of making Nigeria great, and by implication making Africa great, is still in progress. It is my lifelong mission to do all I can to improve the lives of all Africans. The wind of challenges may sometimes shift us away from our destined path, albeit momentarily, but we shall overcome our challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNigeria must dream. Africa must dream. Yes, we may have challenges, yet all I see tells me we will get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must start by unleashing our full potential while managing our challenges. We must make poverty history in Nigeria. We must make poverty history in Africa. We must deliver a better Nigeria, and a better Africa, for this generation and generations to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven the high level of poverty in Africa and Nigeria, what is needed are welfarist policies that exponentially expand opportunities for all, reduce inequalities, and improve the quality of life of people. These must be anchored on public-centric policies and private wealth creation for all. I would like to focus on five areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, rural economic transformation and food security. Second, health care security for all. Third, education for all. Fourth, access to affordable housing for all. Fifth, government accountability and fiscal decentralization for true federalism. First, Nigeria must completely transform its rural economies to ensure food security for all. A better Africa must start with the transformation of rural economies. That is because some 70% of the population live there. Rural poverty is extremely high. At the heart of transforming rural economies is agriculture, the main source of livelihoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen agriculture moves away from being a way of life to a business, everything changes. Higher incomes and wages from agribusinesses will support education and health, and spur even greater job creation for millions of youths. As a young student who attended high school in the village, I witnessed the high correlation of agricultural performance with education. Several of my classmates were children of farmers. I noticed then that when the agricultural season was good, they stayed in school and performed well, but when the season was poor, several dropped out or attended intermittently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe decision by Chief Awolowo to start with the transformation of the rural economy was a very sound policy. The establishment of farm estates, and the expansion of rural roads, supported by professionally run marketing boards helped stabilize the prices of farm produce. It is worth noting that the prudent fiscal management of the cocoa revenues powered the economies of the States that then constituted the Western Region. These revenues allowed the government to embark on an unprecedented idea \u0026#8211; free education and free basic health care services. It was common then to hear the phrase “Agbe lo ba” (farmers are kings), uttered with great pride. We must give new life to our rural areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Chief Awolowo could do this in the 1960s, there is no reason why rural economies today should be immersed in extreme poverty. Clearly, rural economies have been abandoned, by politicians, planning and policies. Today, they have become zones of economic misery. The pauperization of rural economies is what is causing the implosion of many countries across Africa. When rural economies (the fulcrum of the African society) falter, nations falter. This leads to the spread of anarchy, banditry, and terrorism. This troika of social disruption takes advantage of the economic misery to entrench themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe transformation of rural economies must therefore be structural, systemic, strategic and comprehensive. Doing so means agriculture must be turned into a wealth-creating sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aggressively pursued this philosophy when I served as minister of agriculture and rural development of Nigeria from 2011-2015. Many call this period the “farm revolution” years, as Nigeria witnessed an impressive transformation of its agricultural sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith farmer-centric policies, we delivered improved seeds and fertilizers for 15 million farmers. We delivered millions of cocoa seedlings across southern Nigeria. We delivered a cotton transformation across the north. We provided millions of oil palm seedlings to farm estates, including small farmers and large farm estates, across the East, South and West. We accelerated the delivery of improved rice seeds across Nigeria and sparked a rice revolution that transformed several regions across Nigeria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound public policies transform the lives of people. I fondly remember one of my farm trips in the company of the then Governor of Kebbi State, H.E. Usman Dakingari. Amazed by the revolution happening, I recall him saying, “Minister, thank you, we no longer measure our rice yields in hectares of land but in kilometres.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRural economies boomed. Local well-packaged rice took over the market. The price of rice at the time was N6,000 per bag, which helped to stem food price inflation. Unfortunately, today, that same bag of rice, just nine years later, is N77,000 per bag. That 12-fold price increase unfortunately puts rice, a basic staple, beyond the reach of millions of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn several parts of Africa today, farm revolutions are happening at scale, with the support of the African Development Bank. Over the last seven years, we have invested over $8.5 billion in agriculture, which has impacted 250 million people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the core of the Africa-wide strategy to revamp rural economies and turn them into zones of economic prosperity is the development of special agro-industrial processing zones across the continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese zones are being provided with critical supportive infrastructure, including water, roads, processing infrastructure and logistics. The African Development Bank and its partners are providing $1.4 billion for the development of 25 Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones in eleven countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight here in Nigeria, we are developing these zones in 8 states with $518 million. The second phase of the program in Nigeria, which will cover 23 more States, will be financed with $1 billion. The Bank and partners recently launched a $3 billion Alliance for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones.\u003cbr\u003eFeeding Africa is serious business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo ensure that the continent can feed itself and achieve food sovereignty, we organised the Feed Africa Summit in January of 2023, which had 34 African\u003cbr\u003eHeads of State and the President of Ireland are in attendance, as well as global leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn what is a remarkable global development, we were able to secure $72 billion in financial commitments towards the delivery of national food compacts. Second, Nigeria needs health care for all. Smart governments provide universal basic health coverage for their citizens. Africa loses $2.6 trillion annually in productivity, due to sicknesses and diseases. Just as every nation has a national defense system to protect its citizens against all forms of aggression, the same is true for healthcare systems. A nation without a sound health care system is a nation that is defenseless against the invasion of all forms of disease or epidemics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCovid-19 exposed the weakness of Africa’s health systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile developed economies spent $19 trillion in fiscal stimulus programmes, approximately 19% of the world’s GDP, Africa spent only $89 billion. Africa’s urgent need for basic vaccines was pushed to the bottom of global vaccine supply chains. At a time when Africa was unable to provide one basic shot of vaccine, developed countries were providing second, third and more booster shots. It was alarming watching an unprotected Africa grapple with this\u003cbr\u003einsidious virus. Some even projected that as many as 3 million Africans would die from the pandemic. Africa had just two testing centres, no medical gloves, no face masks, no medications, no vaccines. The African Development Bank immediately put in place a $10 billion facility to support African countries in their fight against the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is not acceptable or sustainable is an Africa that imports 70-80% of its medicines and produces just 1% of its vaccines.. The health security of Africa’s 1.4 billion people cannot be subjugated to global supply chains or the generosity of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat’s why the African Development Bank also launched a $3 billion programme to revamp Africa’s pharmaceutical industries and why it established the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation to support access to proprietary technologies from global pharmaceutical companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bank also launched another $3 billion program to develop quality health infrastructure across the continent, with special emphasis on primary health care systems, which if well fixed can assure basic health care for hundreds of millions of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will continue to invest heavily in Nigeria to support its pharmaceutical industry and develop better health infrastructure. It is imperative that Nigeria secures the health of all its population. This will require ensuring that no citizen travels more than a few kilometers to find a healthcare centre. The widespread use of mobile health centres, e-health facilities, the digitalization of health systems, especially in all primary health care centres and health insurance policies for all, including innovative micro-health insurance pay-as-you-go systems, will capture the bulk of the population that is in the informal sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, Nigeria needs education for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNigeria accounts for 15% of the total population of out-of-school children, according to UNICEF, with over 10.2 million at the primary school level, and 8.1 million at the Junior Secondary School. This is not a gold medal Nigeria should be\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eproud of. The problem is both acute and alarming in Northern Nigeria. Urgent public policies, coupled with community sensitization and incentives for schooling are needed, if this trend is to be reversed. Public incentives such as free and 12 compulsory primary and secondary education should be put in place, along with massive investments in training and better salaries for teachers, building quality and safe classrooms, and school feeding programmes.\u003cbr\u003eA well-educated citizenry is critical for technological growth and development, and for fostering creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and global competitiveness. We do not have a choice. A highly educated Nigeria is not an option. It is an imperative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith only 1% of the population enrolled, Nigeria is currently not educating enough of its people at the university level. The poor funding of universities, lack of basic infrastructure, poor incentives for faculty and staff, and incessant strikes due to wage disputes, have almost crippled the university system.\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, there is a mass exodus out of Nigerian universities, with 128,770\u003cbr\u003eNigerian students “Japa-ing” (moving) to study in UK Universities alone, between 2015 and 2022, according to the Higher Education Agency of the United Kingdom. The mass exodus of students pales when compared to those of skilled professionals. From doctors to engineers, architects, lawyers, IT specialists, bankers, and medical technicians, Nigeria is witnessing a massive depletion of its human capital. This human capital hemorrhage will slow down economic growth, performance and overall development and competitiveness of the economy. While one might argue that a growing diaspora is good as they send home some $ billions which is higher than the oil export earnings, this clearly is not the way to develop sustainably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNations that develop do all they can to keep their best human capital at home, and additionally source skills from elsewhere with flexible immigration and haemorrhage policies. We must make Nigeria a viable place for people to stay, and not a place to run away from. The same applies for other countries. I refuse to believe that the future of Nigeria’s and Africa’s youth lie in Europe, North America, Asia or anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe that their future lies in a rapidly developing Nigeria, and Africa, that is able to generate quality jobs with competitive wages and a decent quality of life for millions of youths. That is why the African Development Bank Group and partners have provided $614 million to Nigeria for the i-DICE programme to support the development of digital and creative enterprises, which are expected to create 6.3 million jobs and add an estimated $6.4 billion to the Nigerian economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo support the businesses of young Nigerians, the African Development Bank Group is also planning to establish a Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank in Nigeria which will provide financial instruments to create youth-based wealth. Fourth, Nigeria needs housing for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA better quality of life requires access to decent and affordable housing for all. I remember growing up, how hard my father worked to be able to build us a decent house to stay in, after living for years in high-density areas, in what is called face-me-I-face you. What a joy it was to finally have our own rooms with baths and toilets. This joy eludes hundreds of millions of people in Africa, yet several governments stand watch undeterred and unflinching as millions of their citizens live in slums. Today over 65% of people in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums. Let me bring this closer home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Nigeria, 49% of the population live in slums, according to data by UN-Habitat. That is a staggering 102 million people! These trends need to change, rapidly. Welfarist policies are urgently needed to ensure that 100% of citizens have access to basic and affordable housing. The opprobrious policies that seek to upgrade slums should be jettisoned. There is nothing like a 5-star slum: a slum is a slum.Urgent actions are needed to support mortgage financing and re-financing andthe use of innovative financing structures to raise long-term capital for closing the housing deficits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFifth, Nigeria needs government accountability and fiscal decentralization for a true federalism. Democracy is more than the right to cast a vote. It is the right of citizens to hold governments accountable for improvements in their welfare. Citizen accountability forums are needed in order to have a say in how their nation’s resources are being used and how their governments are performing. Governments must show concrete and transparent evidence of fiscal responsibility.\u003cbr\u003eGovernments without citizen accountability become synonyms for democratic dictatorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, therefore, there is a greater need for e-governance systems to enhance transparency and accountability of governments, in service of the people.\u003cbr\u003eThat is what people-centred governance is all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why the African Development Bank is developing a public service delivery index that will rate governments on the quality-of-service delivery for citizens.\u003cbr\u003eDevelopment clearly requires a significant amount of financing, which governments need to raise. A primary tool for doing so is through taxation. The rationale for raising taxes in Nigeria is that the nation’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low compared to other African or non-African countries. However, taxation in the absence of a social contract between governments and citizens is simply fiscal extortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticipatory tax-based financing systems demand participatory governance. Take the case of Norway for instance. Its tax-to-GDP ratio is 39%. It is easy to make the comparison and say Nigeria needs to raise its taxes from 6.1% of GDP to a similar level as Norway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut consider that in Norway, like all the Nordic countries, education is free through university. And if you finish your course on time, any loans you took to feed yourself, clothe yourself and maintain yourself, are converted into grants. We must distinguish between nominal taxes and implicit taxes — taxes that are borne by the people but are not seen or recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth be told, Nigerians pay one of the highest implicit tax rates in the world. Most of the citizens provide electricity for themselves via generators; they repair roads in their neighborhoods if they can afford to. They provide boreholes\u003cbr\u003efor drinking water with their own monies. In the 21st century, this is incredulous as every household should have pipe borne water!\u003cbr\u003eSadly, the abnormal has been normalized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf people pay taxes, governments must deliver services to citizens and be held accountable for their ability to do so or not. Governments should not transfer their responsibility to citizens. When governments or institutions fail to provide basic services, the people bear the burden of a heavy implicit tax.\u003cbr\u003eTo succeed with much needed welfarist and people-centered policies across Nigeria, it is necessary to change the governance system and decentralize governance to States in order to provide greater autonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStates have tremendous potential to become even more financially autonomous through greater fiscal prudence. If States focus on unlocking thehuge resources they have, based on areas of comparative advantage, they will rapidly expand wealth for their people. With such increased wealth, they will be able to access capital markets and secure long-term financing to fast-track their growth\u003cbr\u003eand development. States that adopt this strategy would have less of a need for monthly trips to Abuja for grants. Instead, part of their federal revenue allocations can be saved as internal \u0026#8216;state sovereign wealth funds\u0026#8217;. This can then be used as guarantees against borrowings from capital markets. In essence, they would be free from needing to exclusively rely on the federal government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get out of the economic quagmire, there is a compelling need for the restructuring of Nigeria. Restructuring should not be driven by political expediency, but by economic and financial viability. Economic and financial viability are the necessary and sufficient conditions for political viability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there was one attribute that defined Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and there were many, it would be his visionary boldness. He went where others feared or failed to go. In the process, decades later, his footprints remain in the sands of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLikewise today, in Nigeria, we need men and women with vision, who are willing to take bold decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurgeries are tough. They are better done well, the first time. The resources found in each state or state groupings should belong to them. The constituent entities should pay federal taxes or royalties for those resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut lets be clear. The achievement of economically viable entities and the viability of the national entity requires constitutional changes to devolve more economic and fiscal powers to the states or regions. The stronger the states, or regions, the stronger the federated units.\u003cbr\u003eIn the process, our union would be renewed. Our union would be stronger. Our union would be equitable. Our union would be fully participatory.\u003cbr\u003eExcellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen. We must be audacious!\u003cbr\u003eInstead of a Federal Government of Nigeria, we could think of The United\u003cbr\u003eStates of Nigeria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe old would give way to the new. We would change the relational mindset between the states and Abuja: the fulcrum would be the states, while the center would support them, not lord over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith good governance and better accountability systems, and a zero tolerance for corruption, more economically stronger constituent states would emerge! We would unleash massive wealth across the states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA New Nigeria would arise!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do so, we will need all of us \u0026#8211; not some of us. From our forgotten rural villages to our boisterous and dynamic urban areas. From the sparks of desire in the eyes of our children, to the lingering hope in the hearts of our youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the yearnings of our women and mothers and our men and fathers for a better tomorrow, and the desires of the old that our end would be better than our past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the hardworking street vendors and small businesses to the largest business conglomerates … we must create a movement of hope.\u003cbr\u003eHope for a better Nigeria!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot a Muslim Nigeria. Not a Christian Nigeria. Not Eastern Nigeria, Western Nigeria, or Northern or Southern Nigeria. But one Nigeria \u0026#8211; a New Nigeria, created by a renewed commitment to turn our amazing diversity into exceptional strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA New Nigeria, powered by torrents of hope, trust, equity, fairness, and wealth at every level, in every state … by all and for all. We have the capacity to do this and make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must rise above mistrust and divisions and make history. Not the history that is written about us, about Northern Nigeria, Southern Nigeria, Eastern Nigeria, or Western Nigeria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot the history of divisive political parties; but a new history that we commit to write for ourselves \u0026#8211; the history of a New Nigeria. We are the history makers. So, let us commit to make history for a New Nigeria!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the darkness of today will soon fade. It will not be long before our star shines brighter as a nation, as welfarist policies and people-centered policies spur shared wealth. A nation where majority prosper, not just a privileged few. A nation that provides real opportunities for the youth. A nation where equality of opportunities for women is a reality, not a dream. A nation where hope is ignited, and dreams are realized. A nation known for wealth, not poverty. A nation set on a hill whose light will never be hidden. A New Nigeria that we all are proud to call home.
