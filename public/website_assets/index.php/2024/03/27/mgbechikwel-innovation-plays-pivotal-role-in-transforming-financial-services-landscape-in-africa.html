<p>Head of Innovations and Product Development at Coronation Registrars Limited, Ekene Mgbechikwel, in this interview with <strong>Kayode Tokede, </strong>said innovation plays a pivotal role in transforming the financial services landscape in Africa, how innovation is the key to unlocking access to financial services for the millions who have been underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems. Excerpts</p>



<p><strong>How do you see the role of innovation in shaping the future of financial services, particularly in the African context?</strong></p>



<p>Innovation plays a pivotal role in transforming the financial services landscape in Africa. By embracing technology and innovative solutions, we can overcome traditional barriers to financial inclusion, drive economic growth, and empower individuals and businesses across the continent to achieve their financial goals. Innovation is the cornerstone of progress, and nowhere is its potential more transformative than in the realm of financial services, especially within the dynamic landscape of Africa. Here, innovation isn&#8217;t just a buzzword; it&#8217;s the driving force propelling economies forward, empowering individuals, and reshaping the very fabric of society.</p>



<p>Picture this: a continent brimming with untapped potential, where traditional barriers are being dismantled by the power of innovation. In Africa, financial inclusion isn&#8217;t just a goal; it&#8217;s a necessity. And innovation is the key to unlocking access to financial services for the millions who have been underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems. Look at what we at Coronation Registrars is doing with our Capital management solutions.</p>



<p>From mobile money revolutionizing payments to blockchain technology transforming remittances and dividend payments, the African financial services sector is a hotbed of ingenuity and disruption. But innovation isn&#8217;t just about flashy technologies; it&#8217;s about solving real problems and meeting the unique needs of diverse communities.</p>



<p>In this context, the role of innovation is multifaceted. It&#8217;s about creating inclusive financial ecosystems that cater to the unbanked and underbanked, providing them with the tools and resources they need to thrive. It&#8217;s about leveraging data analytics and AI to drive financial literacy and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their money. It&#8217;s about fostering partnerships and collaboration across sectors to drive innovation at scale and amplify impact.</p>

<p><strong>As a female leader in the tech industry, what challenges have you faced, and how have you overcome them to drive innovation within Coronation Registrars?</strong></p>



<p>As a female leader in the tech industry, I&#8217;ve encountered a variety of challenges on my journey, but each hurdle has only fueled my determination to drive innovation within my organization.</p>



<p>One of the most prevalent challenges I&#8217;ve faced is breaking through the glass ceiling in a predominantly male-dominated field. Early in my career, I often found myself underestimated or overlooked simply because of my gender. However, I refused to let stereotypes define my capabilities. Instead, I embraced every opportunity to showcase my expertise, competence, and leadership skills. Through perseverance and unwavering confidence in my abilities, I gradually earned the respect and recognition of my peers and superiors.</p>



<p>One of the key challenges I&#8217;ve faced is navigating the gender dynamics prevalent in the tech world. Despite tremendous strides, the industry still grapples with gender bias and stereotypes. As a result, gaining credibility and earning respect as a female leader can sometimes be an uphill battle. Additionally, balancing the demands of a high-pressure career with the responsibilities of marriage and family life presents its own set of challenges, requiring careful prioritization and time management. I&#8217;ve had to juggle competing priorities and overcome the guilt of not always being present in every aspect of my life. I have also been able to allow myself some grace and also to understand that I cannot be successful at all at the same time.</p>



<p>The truth is there is&nbsp;no such thing as balance. That is being a woman. If you are a working woman, you are often not there as much as you’d like to be.&nbsp;So if I spend all day (and sometimes night) brainstorming with my team, I am ultimately missing date night with my partner; If I spend all my time on video calls to my family then I am missing an important board meeting deliverable. That’s what happens. Those are the trade-offs. You must com to terms with the fact that you’re going to miss one thing and be good at another. I’ve always said if I’m winning at one thing, I’m failing at another. And a lot of people say, ‘failure?’ And I say, ‘yes!’ I like to call it failure because it makes me feel better. However, I&#8217;ve come to realize that being a role model and paving the way for future generations of women in tech is a powerful motivator.</p>



<p>Another obstacle I&#8217;ve encountered is navigating the subtle biases and microaggressions that can undermine women&#8217;s authority and credibility in the workplace. Whether it&#8217;s being interrupted in meetings or having my ideas dismissed, I&#8217;ve learned to assert myself assertively and unapologetically. By speaking up and advocating for myself and other women in the industry, I&#8217;m actively working to dismantle the barriers that hinder diversity and inclusion.</p>



<p>Ultimately, overcoming challenges as a female leader and wife has reinforced my commitment to driving innovation and positive change within my organization. By embracing adversity as an opportunity for growth and leading with authenticity, empathy, and resilience, I&#8217;m paving the way for a more inclusive and innovative future in the tech industry.</p>

By embracing technology and innovative solutions, we can overcome traditional barriers to financial inclusion, drive economic growth, and empower individuals and businesses across the continent to achieve their financial goals. Innovation is the cornerstone of progress, and nowhere is its potential more transformative than in the realm of financial services, especially within the dynamic landscape of Africa. Here, innovation isn\u0026#8217;t just a buzzword; it\u0026#8217;s the driving force propelling economies forward, empowering individuals, and reshaping the very fabric of society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePicture this: a continent brimming with untapped potential, where traditional barriers are being dismantled by the power of innovation. In Africa, financial inclusion isn\u0026#8217;t just a goal; it\u0026#8217;s a necessity. And innovation is the key to unlocking access to financial services for the millions who have been underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems. Look at what we at Coronation Registrars is doing with our Capital management solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom mobile money revolutionizing payments to blockchain technology transforming remittances and dividend payments, the African financial services sector is a hotbed of ingenuity and disruption. But innovation isn\u0026#8217;t just about flashy technologies; it\u0026#8217;s about solving real problems and meeting the unique needs of diverse communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this context, the role of innovation is multifaceted. It\u0026#8217;s about creating inclusive financial ecosystems that cater to the unbanked and underbanked, providing them with the tools and resources they need to thrive. It\u0026#8217;s about leveraging data analytics and AI to drive financial literacy and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their money. It\u0026#8217;s about fostering partnerships and collaboration across sectors to drive innovation at scale and amplify impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do these digital solutions align with Coronation Registrars\u0026#8217; broader strategic goals and vision for the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImagine Coronation Registrars as a ship charting its course through the vast seas of innovation and opportunity.

At Coronation Registrars, we have introduced innovative solutions such as\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eShareholderLive,\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;which is a platform built to service our shareholders where they can view their portfolio value and valuations among other services. We have\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eIssuerLive,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003ewhich is an analytics platform tailored to help our issuing companies manage their shareholders and shareholding reports.

Early in my career, I often found myself underestimated or overlooked simply because of my gender. However, I refused to let stereotypes define my capabilities. Instead, I embraced every opportunity to showcase my expertise, competence, and leadership skills. Through perseverance and unwavering confidence in my abilities, I gradually earned the respect and recognition of my peers and superiors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the key challenges I\u0026#8217;ve faced is navigating the gender dynamics prevalent in the tech world. Despite tremendous strides, the industry still grapples with gender bias and stereotypes. As a result, gaining credibility and earning respect as a female leader can sometimes be an uphill battle. Additionally, balancing the demands of a high-pressure career with the responsibilities of marriage and family life presents its own set of challenges, requiring careful prioritization and time management. I\u0026#8217;ve had to juggle competing priorities and overcome the guilt of not always being present in every aspect of my life. I have also been able to allow myself some grace and also to understand that I cannot be successful at all at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is there is\u0026nbsp;no such thing as balance. That is being a woman. If you are a working woman, you are often not there as much as you’d like to be.\u0026nbsp;So if I spend all day (and sometimes night) brainstorming with my team, I am ultimately missing date night with my partner; If I spend all my time on video calls to my family then I am missing an important board meeting deliverable. That’s what happens. Those are the trade-offs. You must com to terms with the fact that you’re going to miss one thing and be good at another. I’ve always said if I’m winning at one thing, I’m failing at another. And a lot of people say, ‘failure?’ And I say, ‘yes!’ I like to call it failure because it makes me feel better. However, I\u0026#8217;ve come to realize that being a role model and paving the way for future generations of women in tech is a powerful motivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother obstacle I\u0026#8217;ve encountered is navigating the subtle biases and microaggressions that can undermine women\u0026#8217;s authority and credibility in the workplace. Whether it\u0026#8217;s being interrupted in meetings or having my ideas dismissed, I\u0026#8217;ve learned to assert myself assertively and unapologetically. By speaking up and advocating for myself and other women in the industry, I\u0026#8217;m actively working to dismantle the barriers that hinder diversity and inclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, overcoming challenges as a female leader and wife has reinforced my commitment to driving innovation and positive change within my organization. By embracing adversity as an opportunity for growth and leading with authenticity, empathy, and resilience, I\u0026#8217;m paving the way for a more inclusive and innovative future in the tech industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you share any success stories or case studies that highlight the impact of Coronation Registrars\u0026#8217; digital solutions on clients and stakeholders?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely!
