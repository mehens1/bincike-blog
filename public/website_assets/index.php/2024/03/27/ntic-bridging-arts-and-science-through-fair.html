<p>Arts and science are disciplines essential in the human community, but many have argued that one is more important than the other. Michael Olugbode reports that the Nigerian Tulip International College, through a recently organised science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics fair with thousands of students in Abuja in attendance, showed that variety is the soul of a community</p>



<p>The argument as to which is superior between science and art has always been there and may perhaps never be resolved. Those who believe science is superior argue that science is much more important than art and see anyone who claims otherwise as extremely deluded. They argue that without art, people will still survive and live. But without science, all these smartphones, fast communication, air travel, the internet and any modern technologies we take for granted, which make our lives easier, would never exist. They see science as necessary for the advancement of society. It is the application of knowledge to solve problems and create new products, services, and technologies. Science has been at the core of humanity’s progress since the dawn of time. It has improved our quality of life, provided us with better health care, created longer-lasting and more efficient energy sources, helped us understand the universe better, and given us a greater understanding of the human body. They would further argue that, in contrast, art is primarily about expression and creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can be thought-provoking and beautiful, it does not necessarily provide tangible benefits like science does. Arts does not have the same problem-solving or research capacity as science. It does not give us new tools or technologies to improve our lives and does not take us any closer to answering questions about how the universe works or why we exist. They would conclude that science is much more useful and important than art because it provides tangible benefits that have shaped our world. It answers our questions and helps us understand the natural world in ways that art cannot. It can potentially make our lives easier, healthier, and more fulfilling. Art may bring beauty and meaning to life, but science is essential for advancing our civilisation.</p>



<p>The relationship between art and science is a captivating and complex interplay that has fascinated thinkers, creators, and scholars throughout history. However, seemingly distinct disciplines, such as arts and science, are more interconnected than one might initially perceive. Arts, often associated with creativity, imagination, and aesthetic expression, and science, characterised by logic, observation, and empirical evidence, share a profound connection that transcends their apparent differences. Together, they form a symbiotic relationship, influencing and enriching one another in ways that push the boundaries of human understanding and creativity.</p>



<p>Art and science, at their core, are both methods of inquiry into the nature of the world. While science seeks to understand and explain phenomena through rigorous observation, experimentation, and analysis, art explores the world through subjective interpretations, emotions, and sensory experiences. Both disciplines strive to make sense of the world and communicate their findings to others, albeit through different means.</p>



<p>The arts refer to expressing or applying human creativity and imagination through visual arts (painting, sculpture, drawing), performing arts (music, dance, theatre), literature, film, and more. They encompass a wide range of disciplines and forms of expression, reflecting subjective interpretations, emotions, aesthetics, and cultural contexts. Artistic endeavours often aim to evoke sensations, provoke thought, convey ideas, or communicate experiences, providing a means for individuals to explore and express their perceptions and perspectives of the world.</p>



<p>On the other hand, science is a systematic and empirical approach to understanding the natural world. It involves the study of the structure, behaviour, and processes of the physical and natural world through observation, experimentation, and analysis. Science relies on rigorous methodologies, logical reasoning, and the scientific method to formulate and test hypotheses, develop theories, and uncover knowledge about the workings of the universe. Scientific disciplines encompass physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, psychology, and many others, intending to advance human understanding, make predictions, and solve practical problems.</p>



<p>Over 1,000 students from over 50 schools in Abuja attended the fair, as well as dignitaries from the Federal Ministry for Sports Development, Federal Ministry for Education, Ministry of Science and Technology, Secretary to Education, and National Mathematical Centre, parents, school administrators, and representatives in the technology and art industry.</p>



<p>The Managing Director of NTIC, Fevzullah Bilgin, essentially stated that art and science are important. He explained that the Nigerian Tulip International Colleges hosted the 2024 edition of the STEAM Fair. STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said NTIC had been providing quality education for the past 25 years, and we understand the significance of creativity and innovation in the learning process. The STEAM fair manifests &#8220;our commitment to providing a platform for students to showcase their talents and explore their interests&#8221; in scientific and artistic fields.</p>



<p>He noted that the NTIC STEAM fair had been an annual event until the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020 and 2021. We are grateful that we have all overcome that phase, not only in Nigeria but also in the world in general.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that science &#8220;is the bedrock of human understanding, a relentless journey to unravel the mysteries of the universe,&#8221; noting that scientists uncover the fundamental laws that govern our world through meticulous observation, experimentation, and analysis. From the microscopic intricacies of cells to the vast expanse of the cosmos, science provides us with the tools to comprehend the intricacies of existence.</p>



<p>Moreover, the scientific process is inherently creative, according to Bilgin, noting that it demands curiosity, imagination, and the courage to question established norms. In this way, science and art share common ground, as both are fueled by the innate human desire to explore the unknown and make sense of our surroundings.</p>



<p>Bilgin added that art, in its myriad forms, is the language of emotion and expression. Whether through painting, sculpture, music, or literature, artists communicate the intangible aspects of the human experience. Art captures the essence of our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, transcending the limitations of language.</p>



<p>However, he said remarkably, the creative process in art mirrors the scientific method. Artists experiment with colours, textures, and sounds to evoke specific emotions or convey particular messages. The fusion of science and art is evident in digital art, where technology becomes the canvas, bridging the gap between the tangible and the virtual.</p>



<p>He admitted that technology, the driving force behind our modern age, serves as the catalyst for innovation. It transforms abstract ideas into tangible realities, shaping the way we live, work, and interact. From the printing press to the internet, technological advancements have propelled humanity forward, breaking down barriers and connecting us in unprecedented ways. Moreover, technology and art often intertwine to create breathtaking possibilities. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive installations blend the boundaries between the physical and digital realms, offering new avenues for artistic expression and immersive experiences.</p>



<p>He noted that the intersection of science, art, and technology forms a dynamic nexus that propels human progress. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, let us embrace the symbiotic relationship between these domains, fostering a culture that celebrates both the analytical rigour of science and the boundless creativity of art. Together, they weave a tapestry of understanding, innovation, and inspiration that enriches our collective journey through time and space.</p>



<p>He revealed that the focus of the STEAM Fair is to allow for exploration and discovery and to provide opportunities to seek solutions to real-world problems.</p>



<p>Bilgin explained that as &#8220;we wander through the aisles of this fair, we will witness this integration firsthand, as students present projects that seamlessly blend&#8221; science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. With these projects, &#8220;our students and other exhibitors will be demonstrating their academic prowess and also their ability to think critically, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively &#8211; skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.&#8221;</p>



<p>He appealed that as &#8220;we engage with each exhibitor, ask questions, seek clarity, and most importantly, celebrate the spirit of curiosity, innovation, and excellence that led to what the students are presenting,” adding that “we hope to encourage and inspire them further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minister of Sports Development, Senator John Enoh, commended the existing relationship between NTIC and the Federal Ministry of Sports Development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He emphasised the MOU between NTIC and his ministry, promised to honour it, and also looked for new areas in which to collaborate with NTIC. He said the Ministry of Sports Development has fashioned plans and modalities to improve the sector, especially the National Youth Games, which will help them discover talents early and secure free training and scholarships within and outside the country.</p>



<p>He commended NTIC for already giving scholarships to some discovered talents and their contribution to the growth of sports, the growth of the country’s economy, quality education, and numerous job creations, assuring his ministry&#8217;s readiness to partner with the institution.</p>



<p>The Secretary for Education, Federal Capital Territory, Dr. Danlami Hayyo, said he was happy to be at the fair. He applauded the NTIC for their commendable achievements and the special priority given to Science and Technology, which has made some of the students reverse their courses and enter Science and Technology.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the federal government called for the establishment of model schools across the country to encourage the knowledge of science and technology that would position Nigeria for modernisation.</p>



<p>The call was made by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, Chief Uche Geoffrey Nnaji, at the Annual Science Technology Engineering Art Math (STEAM) Fair.</p>



<p>Nnaji said there was a need for model schools in all parts of the country to boost young people&#8217;s knowledge and build the road to the nation’s technological advancement.</p>



<p>He noted that various policies are underway to boost the country&#8217;s development in nanotechnology and other scientific and technological fields.</p>



<p>Going by the exhibition at the fair, one cannot but say both science and art are important, and man would not want to do away with either.</p>

Michael Olugbode reports that the Nigerian Tulip International College, through a recently organised science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics fair with thousands of students in Abuja in attendance, showed that variety is the soul of a community\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe argument as to which is superior between science and art has always been there and may perhaps never be resolved. Those who believe science is superior argue that science is much more important than art and see anyone who claims otherwise as extremely deluded. They argue that without art, people will still survive and live. But without science, all these smartphones, fast communication, air travel, the internet and any modern technologies we take for granted, which make our lives easier, would never exist. They see science as necessary for the advancement of society. It is the application of knowledge to solve problems and create new products, services, and technologies. Science has been at the core of humanity’s progress since the dawn of time. It has improved our quality of life, provided us with better health care, created longer-lasting and more efficient energy sources, helped us understand the universe better, and given us a greater understanding of the human body. They would further argue that, in contrast, art is primarily about expression and creativity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it can be thought-provoking and beautiful, it does not necessarily provide tangible benefits like science does. Arts does not have the same problem-solving or research capacity as science. It does not give us new tools or technologies to improve our lives and does not take us any closer to answering questions about how the universe works or why we exist. They would conclude that science is much more useful and important than art because it provides tangible benefits that have shaped our world. It answers our questions and helps us understand the natural world in ways that art cannot. It can potentially make our lives easier, healthier, and more fulfilling. Art may bring beauty and meaning to life, but science is essential for advancing our civilisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between art and science is a captivating and complex interplay that has fascinated thinkers, creators, and scholars throughout history. However, seemingly distinct disciplines, such as arts and science, are more interconnected than one might initially perceive. Arts, often associated with creativity, imagination, and aesthetic expression, and science, characterised by logic, observation, and empirical evidence, share a profound connection that transcends their apparent differences. Together, they form a symbiotic relationship, influencing and enriching one another in ways that push the boundaries of human understanding and creativity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eArt and science, at their core, are both methods of inquiry into the nature of the world. While science seeks to understand and explain phenomena through rigorous observation, experimentation, and analysis, art explores the world through subjective interpretations, emotions, and sensory experiences. Both disciplines strive to make sense of the world and communicate their findings to others, albeit through different means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe arts refer to expressing or applying human creativity and imagination through visual arts (painting, sculpture, drawing), performing arts (music, dance, theatre), literature, film, and more. They encompass a wide range of disciplines and forms of expression, reflecting subjective interpretations, emotions, aesthetics, and cultural contexts. Artistic endeavours often aim to evoke sensations, provoke thought, convey ideas, or communicate experiences, providing a means for individuals to explore and express their perceptions and perspectives of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, science is a systematic and empirical approach to understanding the natural world. It involves the study of the structure, behaviour, and processes of the physical and natural world through observation, experimentation, and analysis. Science relies on rigorous methodologies, logical reasoning, and the scientific method to formulate and test hypotheses, develop theories, and uncover knowledge about the workings of the universe. Scientific disciplines encompass physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, psychology, and many others, intending to advance human understanding, make predictions, and solve practical problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 1,000 students from over 50 schools in Abuja attended the fair, as well as dignitaries from the Federal Ministry for Sports Development, Federal Ministry for Education, Ministry of Science and Technology, Secretary to Education, and National Mathematical Centre, parents, school administrators, and representatives in the technology and art industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Managing Director of NTIC, Fevzullah Bilgin, essentially stated that art and science are important. He explained that the Nigerian Tulip International Colleges hosted the 2024 edition of the STEAM Fair. STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe said NTIC had been providing quality education for the past 25 years, and we understand the significance of creativity and innovation in the learning process. The STEAM fair manifests \u0026#8220;our commitment to providing a platform for students to showcase their talents and explore their interests\u0026#8221; in scientific and artistic fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted that the NTIC STEAM fair had been an annual event until the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020 and 2021. We are grateful that we have all overcome that phase, not only in Nigeria but also in the world in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe also mentioned that science \u0026#8220;is the bedrock of human understanding, a relentless journey to unravel the mysteries of the universe,\u0026#8221; noting that scientists uncover the fundamental laws that govern our world through meticulous observation, experimentation, and analysis. From the microscopic intricacies of cells to the vast expanse of the cosmos, science provides us with the tools to comprehend the intricacies of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the scientific process is inherently creative, according to Bilgin, noting that it demands curiosity, imagination, and the courage to question established norms. In this way, science and art share common ground, as both are fueled by the innate human desire to explore the unknown and make sense of our surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBilgin added that art, in its myriad forms, is the language of emotion and expression. Whether through painting, sculpture, music, or literature, artists communicate the intangible aspects of the human experience. Art captures the essence of our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, transcending the limitations of language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he said remarkably, the creative process in art mirrors the scientific method. Artists experiment with colours, textures, and sounds to evoke specific emotions or convey particular messages. The fusion of science and art is evident in digital art, where technology becomes the canvas, bridging the gap between the tangible and the virtual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe admitted that technology, the driving force behind our modern age, serves as the catalyst for innovation. It transforms abstract ideas into tangible realities, shaping the way we live, work, and interact. From the printing press to the internet, technological advancements have propelled humanity forward, breaking down barriers and connecting us in unprecedented ways. Moreover, technology and art often intertwine to create breathtaking possibilities. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive installations blend the boundaries between the physical and digital realms, offering new avenues for artistic expression and immersive experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted that the intersection of science, art, and technology forms a dynamic nexus that propels human progress. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, let us embrace the symbiotic relationship between these domains, fostering a culture that celebrates both the analytical rigour of science and the boundless creativity of art. Together, they weave a tapestry of understanding, innovation, and inspiration that enriches our collective journey through time and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe revealed that the focus of the STEAM Fair is to allow for exploration and discovery and to provide opportunities to seek solutions to real-world problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBilgin explained that as \u0026#8220;we wander through the aisles of this fair, we will witness this integration firsthand, as students present projects that seamlessly blend\u0026#8221; science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. With these projects, \u0026#8220;our students and other exhibitors will be demonstrating their academic prowess and also their ability to think critically, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively \u0026#8211; skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe appealed that as \u0026#8220;we engage with each exhibitor, ask questions, seek clarity, and most importantly, celebrate the spirit of curiosity, innovation, and excellence that led to what the students are presenting,” adding that “we hope to encourage and inspire them further.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Minister of Sports Development, Senator John Enoh, commended the existing relationship between NTIC and the Federal Ministry of Sports Development.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe emphasised the MOU between NTIC and his ministry, promised to honour it, and also looked for new areas in which to collaborate with NTIC. He said the Ministry of Sports Development has fashioned plans and modalities to improve the sector, especially the National Youth Games, which will help them discover talents early and secure free training and scholarships within and outside the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe commended NTIC for already giving scholarships to some discovered talents and their contribution to the growth of sports, the growth of the country’s economy, quality education, and numerous job creations, assuring his ministry\u0026#8217;s readiness to partner with the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary for Education, Federal Capital Territory, Dr. Danlami Hayyo, said he was happy to be at the fair. He applauded the NTIC for their commendable achievements and the special priority given to Science and Technology, which has made some of the students reverse their courses and enter Science and Technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the federal government called for the establishment of model schools across the country to encourage the knowledge of science and technology that would position Nigeria for modernisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was made by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, Chief Uche Geoffrey Nnaji, at the Annual Science Technology Engineering Art Math (STEAM) Fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNnaji said there was a need for model schools in all parts of the country to boost young people\u0026#8217;s knowledge and build the road to the nation’s technological advancement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted that various policies are underway to boost the country\u0026#8217;s development in nanotechnology and other scientific and technological fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoing by the exhibition at the fair, one cannot but say both science and art are important, and man would not want to do away with either.\u003c/p\u003e\n","categoryId":7572,"thumbnail":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/L.jpg","url":"/index.php/2024/03/27/ntic-bridging-arts-and-science-through-fair","tags":[]},"categoryName":"Education","nextPosts":[{"title":"Diri’s
